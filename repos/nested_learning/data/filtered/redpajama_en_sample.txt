As Deadline reported on Tuesday, and according to a press release on StarWars.com, Abrams will return to write and direct "Star Wars: Episode IX." The statement reads: A post shared by Star Wars (@starwars) on Sep 12, 2017 at 7:28am PDT After Disney unexpectedly parted ways with former "Episode IX" director Colin Trevorrow earlier this month, rumors that Rian Johnson, who is directing "Star Wars: The Last Jedi," would take over surfaced. But Deadline reports that Johnson decided not to take the offer to direct. On Abrams' hiring, Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy said, "With 'The Force Awakens,' J.J. delivered everything we could have possibly hoped for, and I am so excited that he is coming back to close out this trilogy." After what we saw in "Force Awakens," we're pretty excited about it, too. We just hope they call it "The Return of the J.J."

the andreas [dot] humm unifr [dot] ch (program coordinator) to receive information about the Joint Master's program. Holders of a Bachelor's degree in computer science from a University of Applied Sciences (with, in principle, a grade average of at least 5.0 in their Bachelor studies), or holders of a different type of University degree (in particular holders of a bachelor degree with a minor in computer science) can also submit an application to the matriculation services for consideration for admission. In such cases, the applications are considered on a case by case basis and the branch committee may require the applicant to earn additional ECTS credits (a maximum of 60) from courses at the Bachelor's level in a so-called "complement to the master program". The goal of the complement to the master program is to complete the knowledge and skills of the previous studies to be prepared to the master program. The complement to the master program is usually composed by courses at the Bachelor's level in computer science and/or mathematics. The total number of credits that have to be earned in the complement to the master program and the exact list of courses (individual study plan) are defined by the branch committee on a case by case basis at the moment of treating the request for admission of the candidate. These credits can be acquired in parallel to the master studies but before starting the master thesis. Since courses are mainly taught in English, sometimes also in French or German, knowledge of English is required; knowledge of French or German is a plus. Independent which home university a student chooses, an admission request (from an academic point of view) is only treated once by the same competent authority, the branch committee. These deadlines do not apply for students who are already registered for a program at one of the BeNeFri universities.
A Tribute to Late Professor Mahlagha Ghorbanli This edition of IJPP celebrates ten years of steady publication of Iranian Journal of Plant Physiology. The story of IJPP is that of a journey that started from a local forum where the researchers and scholars mainly from the Islamic Azad University could share findings of their studies, gradually developing into an international peer-reviewed journal indexed by Islamic World Science Citation Center (https://isc.gov.ir/en) and SCImago Journal & Country Rank (www.scimagojr.com). We heartily appreciate numerous authors, both local and international, whose contributions have led us reach this far and look forward to more original research reports to move even further. This edition is dedicated to late Mahlagha Ghorbanli, the emerita full professor of plant physiology in Kharazmi University, the first institution for teacher education in Iran. With her broad range of expertise and comprehensive knowledge of various research avenues in the field of plant physiology combined with a warm, caring, and supportive personality, professor Ghorbanli was the first Editor-in-Chief of IJPP, a prominent figure who was able to lead the editorial board of IJPP through the challenges inherent in starting a scientific journal. We owe much of what we have achieved to her scholarship and visions. May her soul rest in peace! Iranian Journal of Plant Physiology (2020). A Tribute to Late Professor Mahlagha Ghorbanli.

Mass. Medical, Dental Societies call for professional judgment in pain control Susan Spencer TELEGRAM & GAZETTE STAFF Massachusetts Medical Society and Massachusetts Dental Society representatives say they're concerned about the misuse of prescribed medications, but also call for regulatory balance that allows prescribers to use their professional judgment to provide care that's best for patients. "One of the unintended consequences is where you're so regulated, you're afraid to prescribe and people won't get the pain medication they need," said Dr. Ronald W. Dunlap, a cardiologist and president of the Medical Society. "We all have different pain thresholds. Some people have terrible pain." Dr. Dunlap said the Medical Society was working with regulators to make the state Department of Public Health's Prescription Monitoring Program, a database of controlled substance prescriptions, less burdensome to use. He also said pharmacy chains have extensive databases that could be used with DPH's data to identify providers who prescribe a large number of opioids. Dr. Thomas Trowbridge, an oral surgeon in Lowell and a trustee of the Dental Society, said, "It's in our interest to promote the patient's appropriate amount of pain control." He said adequately controlling pain hastens the healing process and helps patients get back to work or school. The amount of medication needed varies by the weight and age of the patient, the procedure performed and other factors. Dr. Trowbridge said that anecdotes about young people receiving large Vicodin or Percocet prescriptions after having their wisdom teeth removed needed to be taken in context. "Often times it will be the first time for surgery where they've had to have pain control," Dr. Trowbridge said. But also, many people who don't share their anecdotes have wisdom teeth removed without notable post-surgery prescriptions, large or small. "If we give them too few, it's been harder to call in more prescriptions," Dr. Trowbridge said, particularly for Schedule II drugs including Percocet and OxyContin, which in Massachusetts cannot be phoned in to the pharmacy. "It's always good to have enough medicine ahead of time and prepare them for recovery."
The new U.S. National Defense Strategy: A "good deal" for the Military-Industrial Complex Feb 9th, 2018 + In this article:defense, Military Strategy, Politics, society, United States, War On January 19, 2018, U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis presented in Washington the declassified version of the United States' National Defense Strategy. In his speech, he made clear the militaristic approach that will be maintained in coming years: "This strategy expands our competitive space, prioritizes preparedness for war." According to Mattis, the fight against terrorism will continue, "but Great Power competition, not terrorism, is now the primary focus of U.S. national security," which means a readjustment of the approach since the attacks of September 11, 2001. In line with the National Security Strategy of December 2017, Russia and China are identified as the main threats to the U.S. On a second level, are the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Iran, and the most dangerous non-state actor is identified as the Islamic State. The document notes, "The 2018 National Defense Strategy underpins our planned fiscal year 2019-2023 budgets, accelerating our modernization programs and devoting additional resources in a sustained effort to solidify our competitive advantage." In this sense, the U.S. will prioritize nuclear modernization, and investments in cyber and missile defense. This the first time, in more than 15 years, that the U.S. has explicitly stated its interest in increasing military spending to maintain superiority over Russia and China, and consolidate its global hegemony. During this period, international terrorism served as the pretext for the strengthening of U.S. military forces, since after the fall of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, the supposed threat that led the United States to exponentially increase its military budget after WWII, to the benefit of influential corporations, disappeared. The language used recalls the Cold War era East-West conflict. The greatest exponent of the arms race was President Ronald Reagan, who in 1983 publicly launched the Strategic Defense Initiative, in which the scientific community was asked to develop a missile defense system to guarantee the protection of U.S. territory against a nuclear attack. It was also known as "Star Wars," like the famous film of the time. As was shown that on that occasion, the only winner was "the Military-Industrial Complex." The current Strategy also reaffirms that the use of force will be applied as a foreign policy principle: "Reinforcing America's traditional tools of diplomacy, the Department provides military options to ensure the President and our diplomats negotiate from a position of strength." In addition, it is noted that states are the main actors on the global scene, but that non-state actors, such as terrorists, transnational criminal organizations, and hackers, "also threaten the security environment with increasingly sophisticated capabilities." The document emphasizes that the new strategy "articulates our strategy to compete, deter, and win" in this increasingly complex environment, stressing, "The costs of not implementing this strategy are clear. Failure to meet our defense objectives will result in decreasing U.S. global influence, eroding cohesion among allies and partners, and reduced access to markets that will contribute to a decline in our prosperity and standard of living." It is noted: "A long-term strategic competition requires the seamless integration of multiple elements of national power – diplomacy, information, economics, finance, intelligence, law enforcement, and military," continuing: "More than any other nation, America can expand the competitive space, seizing the initiative to challenge our competitors where we possess advantages and they lack strength." At the same time, it is claimed the U.S. "is open to opportunities for cooperation but from a position of strength and based on our national interests." Latin America and the Caribbean are mentioned only twice, referring to the Western Hemisphere, and unlike the Strategy of December 2017, no specific country of the region is mentioned. The objectives of the Strategy include "maintaining favorable regional balances of power in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and the Western Hemisphere." As outlined, the U.S. will deepen its relations with Latin American and Caribbean countries that "contribute military capabilities to shared regional and global security challenges." The document also notes, "The U.S. derives immense benefit from a stable, peaceful hemisphere that reduces security threats to the homeland." Although not recognized in the Strategy, it is worth mentioning that Latin America and the Caribbean is the most densely populated area in the world, and that more than half a century ago, it was declared a nuclear-weapon-free zone, through the Treaty of Tlatelolco. Last month marked four years since the 33 member countries of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), meeting at their Second Summit, in Havana January 28-29, 2014, declared "Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace." This is the "civilized" world of the 21st century – some proclaim peace while others enact war. The Pentagon has revealed it is committed to building "a more lethal force," in clear defiance of international peace, and to justify its 700 billion dollar military budget for 2018. The Strategy defends President Donald Trump's nationalist electoral platform of "America first," which combines diplomatic isolationism and economic protectionism, with military reinforcement and the denial of the threat of climate change. A "novel" formula to try to maintain global hegemony, and another "good deal" for the Military-Industrial Complex. 2016 NATO spending by country with percentage of total In millions of dollars U.S. 72.36% – $664.058 UK 6.5% – $60.347 France 4.7% – $43.620 Germany 4.4% – $40.663 Italy 2.3% – $21.878 Canada 1.6% – $15.395 Turkey 1.2% – $11.573 Spain 1.2% – $11.064 Others 5.4% – $49.698
Reader reviews and comments on Academy Street, plus links to write your own review. Academy Street is the first novel by Irish author, Mary Costello. It chronicles the life of Teresa Lohan, from her youth in rural Ireland in the 1940s through her time in New York and her return to Ireland in her sixties. Tess is seemingly unremarkable, both as a child and an adult: a shy, sensitive child; a woman with an essential loneliness ("It seemed at times that she was marooned on an island, a moat of water, wide and black, separating her from all human love."); a mother who feels she could have done better. Nonetheless, Costello's exquisite prose conveys this life with such emotion, such care, that the reader cannot help but be moved. Costello paints her character so vividly, so completely, that the reader can identify with Tess, her feelings ("…the mark of all anxiety: the acute awareness of the endless possibilities that can simultaneously imperil and enhance us, and all that might be lost or gained."), her ideas ("It Ireland seemed to her now to be a place without dreams, or where dreaming was prohibited. Here, life could be lived at a higher, truer pitch. Though her own was a timid life, there was, since Theo's birth, a yearning towards motion and spirit and vitality."), her reactions ("She thought of the water that had lain quietly calm, each tiny drop, each molecule, restful, suddenly wrenched, catapulted through a metal rotary, tossed back out into the turbulent current, reeling, confounded, changed."). In both style and content, this novel is reminiscent of Sebastian Barry's work, in particular, "On Canaan's Side". A remarkable debut novel.

I love the sounds of Jerusalem. The voices, noises, and music all tell stories that are unparalleled in the Jewish world – and perhaps in the world at large. One I find so compelling is that of my story and the story of the "other," which I hear simultaneously. There a variety of others in Jerusalem – Arabic, Russian, Amharic, Yiddish, and Hebrew – and over the course of a week, I can listen and hear these voices and countless more. It is one of the incredible characteristics of our city. Join me on a brief tour of some of the other voices I am so fortunate to hear regularly in Jerusalem. Saruat shared her voice honestly and directly, telling us she came to Hebrew University intent on learning, but determined never to interact with Jewish Israelis. It was a harsh message. Hearing about the challenges she faces as a person without a country was painful, too. But, we were inspired by the story of the journey that led Saruat to seek out interactions with Jewish Israelis. At URJ Heller High, we make sure students have ample opportunities to hear voices of others whom they may not otherwise encounter. When they learn about contemporary Jewry, they meet an ultra-Orthodox couple (and representatives of other streams of Judaism). The encounter may be the only time students have the chance to listen to Haredi Jews talk about what they believe and represent, and how they are different from other Jews we may know. It's important for students – and all of us – to listen with an open mind to people who express theological, philosophical, and practical opinions that are completely foreign to them and often contradict their own deeply held beliefs. Almost every semester, our ultra-Orthodox guests stay well past the allotted time to answer students' many questions. Erev Shabbat, Friday night, at the Western Wall (the Kotel) is the time and place to hear your own voice and those of others at the same time. Two weeks ago, we were at the egalitarian Kotel for the first Kabbalat Shabbat service of the semester. Just as we started our service, the muezzin (Muslim prayer leader) started chanting the call to prayer over the loudspeakers of the Al Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount, and the Middle Eastern music echoed throughout the Kotel plaza. At the same time, a group of yeshiva students began their Kabbalat Shabbat prayers which rebounded off the Kotel and into the area where we were seated. From over the wall, we heard prayers of the multitude of minyanim (prayer groups) at the "classic" Kotel floating heavenward. Although there were no church bells ringing in the mix, you could easily imagine them joining in on the chorus of prayerful sounds. Sitting at the egalitarian Kotel, I asked the students to listen and take in the divine sounds of erev Shabbat at the Kotel. After listening, we added our own voices to the Friday night symphony that is the Kotel. The Hebrew word "sh'ma" and its variants appear 303 times in the Torah. That one word appears so many times demands our attention. In a world in which truly listening to the other is quickly becoming a lost art, the Torah reminds us of the supreme importance of this act. Throughout the semester, our students have ample opportunities to cultivate this skill – in class with peers, in the dining hall with kibbutzniks, during mifgashim (get togethers) with Israeli high school peers, and during presentations by people who live extremely different lives than they do, including a former teacher who is now a settler and a Palestinian student who lives in East Jerusalem. Hearing and listening to these varied sounds and voices of Jerusalem and Israel – and finding value in both those that are familiar and those that are "other" – give students their own incredible stories to tell when they return home at the end of the semester. Rabbi Loren Sykes lives in Jerusalem, Israel, where he is the principal of URJ Heller High.
When you have an event, and you are expecting a lot of people example for a wedding then you will need a corporate catering company that will help you by ensuring that your guests leave the place when they have enjoyed the food. The food and drinks that are always in ceremonies are of importance because the people attending the party will not have to leave early as they will be sorted out in the right manner. The corporate catering company will be able to attain that if they are experienced, and they can know the amount to be serving in case they notice the amount of food and the number of people are not adding up. If you have no idea of where to find corporate catering company then you can ask around from people or companies where they get their caterers from. You will have saved yourself some time and energy. When you search online, you will get a lot of information about different corporate catering companies. The following are some of the things that you should be added when searching for a corporate catering company. It should be one made of a team that is experienced. The right one to choose is the one that is well experienced as you will be at peace with them. The corporate catering company should be one that takes hygiene seriously because if they mess, then they will have messed up a big congregation. It should be an independent corporate catering company that has their things. That will make them seem focused on what they are doing. They should also have excellent communication skills so that they can relate well with the people in the event. It should be a caring catering team that provides that everyone has been served. That is the best way to go about it because that is how people will end up like their services. The corporate catering company should have an idea of how surprises go about. They can come up with their way of surprising the guests. It difficult to get such a company but they are there. It should be known by a lot of people around the city. You will be able to know that once you interview a few people around the area. You can as well ask the people who have worked with them as they will tell you according to their view. It will be better when you go to the one that a friend has advised you because they might have had an experience with it. That is because of the excellent job they do once they have been asked to make a meal and serve the guests. The corporate catering company must be providing quality services.

Santander extends shared parental leave to grandparents Santander, which employs around 600 people in Glasgow, has been judged one of The Times Top 100 Graduate Employers for 2016-17. The prestigious rankings, now in their eighteenth year, are based on research among more than 18,300 final year students who left university this year. The students are asked which employers they feel offer the best opportunities for graduates, with the feedback used to compile the top 100 list. Santander is the highest newcomer to the awards, and the Bank of England is the biggest climber. Iain Gallagher, Emerging Talent Senior Manager at Santander, said: "We're delighted to be included in The Times Top 100 Graduate Employers and even more so because it's feedback directly from the graduates themselves. It's really important for us to appeal to young talent from all walks of life, so it's great that we've been rated so highly by UK graduates." Scott Reeves, Graduate Relationship Manager, joined Santander in Glasgow having graduated from University of Edinburgh this summer. He said: "I'm seeing first-hand the opportunities Santander offers graduates and these drew me to the bank in the first instance. There is a wide variety of career paths open to people joining the bank and Santander's commitment to ensuring you develop throughout your career means there are lots of opportunities as you progress." The Times Top 100 Graduate Employers has been compiled from research with 18,353 final year students who left university in the summer of 2016 and is published as a full-colour hard-backed book. 60,000 copies are distributed free-of-charge to undergraduates through local careers services at fifty leading universities.

House Votes to Condemn Trump's 'Racist' Comments Latest Stories, 1 Dead, 8 Hurt in Colorado School Shooting; 2 in Custody Two students opened fire Tuesday inside a charter school in an affluent suburban Denver community not far from Columbine High School, killing a teenager, wounding eight and spreading terror before they were taken into custody with no injuries, authorities said. Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said the pair walked into the STEM School Highlands Ranch and began shooting students in two classrooms. Within minutes, deputies at a nearby sheriff's department substation entered the school and arrested the two suspects after a struggle. "As officers were arriving at the school, they could still hear gunshots," Douglas County Undersheriff Holly Nicholson-Kluth said. Authorities did not release the name of the student who died, but said it was an 18-year-old man. "I have to believe that the quick response of the officers that got inside that school helped save lives," Spurlock said. He did not identify the suspects, but said they are an adult and a minor who were not previously known to authorities. Authorities planned to search their homes and a vehicle at the school, he said. The shooting comes nearly three weeks after neighboring Littleton marked the grim 20th anniversary of the Columbine school massacre that killed 13 people. The two schools are separated by about 7 miles (11 kilometers) in adjacent communities south of Denver. It also comes exactly a week after a gunman killed two students and wounded four at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. The STEM School Highlands Ranch is a public charter school with more than 1,850 students in kindergarten through 12th grades. Witness accounts Student Christian Paulson told television station KMGH that he was in study hall when he saw kids running and shouting, "School shooter!" "And I'm like, what? Is this real or fake? And then I just went after them," Christian Paulson said. "And apparently, this is all real. And I tried to run with my life, but I'm out of breath." Rocco DeChalk, who lives near the school, told television station KUSA that he saw so many students running past his house that at first he thought it was a gym class. He went outside and saw a teenage boy who had been shot in the back being helped by a teacher and another student. They brought the boy into his kitchen and alerted a police officer, who sent for an ambulance. "He made a comment, 'Oh, I'm starting to feel it now,'" DeChalk said. "I told him that was probably the adrenaline kicking in and he was going into shock." Three area hospitals reported treating eight people in connection with the attack. Two were listed in serious condition, two were listed as stable, one was in good condition and three were released. Evacuating students Lines of firetrucks, ambulances and law enforcement vehicles from multiple agencies were at the school, and medical helicopters landed on a grassy field. The sheriff's office directed parents to a nearby recreational center to pick up their children. A fleet of school buses arrived and dropped off students, some of whom were crying and holding hands with their classmates as they were helped off. An ambulance also pulled up and let out a half-dozen children, none of whom appeared to be physically injured. "We know this is a very worrisome situation for parents," Nicholson-Kluth said. "Relatives are worried, and we are trying to get them back together as soon as possible." Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that he was making state public-safety resources available to help secure the site and evacuate students. "The heart of all Colorado is with the victims and their families," he said. Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, a gun-control supporter whose congressional district includes STEM, said the gun violence cannot continue. "It is not enough to send thoughts and prayers. It is empty. It is weak, and it does an injustice to our children who are on the front lines of this violence," he said. Credit : Voice of America (VOA) From developing a stutter and anxiety.

Spin or Whoppers? Over the last decade, the media have become obsessed with 'spin'. It's rare to pick up a newspaper without some reference to it. We have satirical programmes about it. But, I'm not sure there is any more of it today than when Bernard Ingham span for Margaret Thatcher, although it's probably more professionally done nowadays. We shouldn't be surprised by 'spin', for it is simply 'putting the best gloss on your story'. Surely nobody expects that anyone, whose reputation is in the public arena, would deliberately go out to 'put the worst gloss' on what they want to say? But there is a big difference between 'spin' and 'telling whoppers'. I only wish our media became more obsessed with the latter than the former. In that way, they would do a public service by properly holding public representatives to account. My Barnsley colleague, Michael Dugher, has just published a long list of 'Whoppers' that David Cameron has told at Prime Ministers' Questions over the last 12 months. Of course, we all occasionally make mistakes. Last week, my friend David Blunkett got something wrong in an interview on Radio 4; but, discovering his mistake, he was back on the radio within 30 minutes to apologise and to correct his error. But, to the best of my knowledge, David Cameron hasn't once set about correcting one of his 'whoppers'. He does us all a dis-service. And these things are not unimportant, because our Prime Ministers's statements are publicised throughout the world and, if left uncorrected, give a clearly wrong impression of what is happening. Judge for yourself, with these examples of what Mr Cameron said at PMQs on January 25th and what the facts actually are: David Cameron: "Hospital waiting times are down" Fact: The number of patients not being treated within 18 weeks has soared by 43% since Mr Cameron became PM David Cameron: "Disabled children will not have their benefits cut." Fact: Department for Work and Pensions' assessment on the new universal credit showing that the rate paid to disabled children will fall from £53.84 to £26.75 a week. David Cameron: "There are more people in work today than there were at the time of the last election" Fact: The Office for National Statistics says there are now 26,000 fewer people in work than at the last election. I'd prefer more spin and fewer whoppers.
Inquest into Albanian seaman's death postponed as official investigation continues Bethany Whymark Published: 4:37 PM February 8, 2019 Alfred Ismaili at home in Albania with his three young children. Picture courtesy of the Ismaili family. - Credit: Archant An inquest into the death of an Albanian seaman in west Norfolk has been postponed again while investigations continue into the accident which led to the death. Alfred Ismaili, 36, died on February 1, 2018 while working on a cargo ship at Alexandra Dock in King's Lynn. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency is undertaking an investigation into his death, in which suspected breaches of regulation have been uncovered. Johanna Thompson, assistant coroner for Norfolk, said that additional evidence needed to be submitted in the on-going investigation including on safe hatch lifting practises. Mr Ismaili's inquest opening heard he died from a blunt force trauma injury. A previous inquest review heard that the investigation into his death could lead to a criminal prosecution. A further pre-inquest review was scheduled for May 2, 2019.
Invisible Hands VOICES FROM THE GLOBAL ECONOMY Edited by Corrine Goria Foreword by Kalpona Akter The men and women in Invisible Hands reveal the human rights abuses occurring behind the scenes of the global economy. The men and women in Invisible Hands reveal the human rights abuses occurring behind the scenes of the global economy. These narrators — including phone manufacturers in China, copper miners in Zambia, garment workers in Bangladesh, and farmers around the world — reveal the secret history of the things we buy, including lives and communities devastated by low wages, environmental degradation, and political repression. Sweeping in scope and rich in detail, these stories capture the interconnectivity of all people struggling to support themselves and their families. Narrators include Kalpona, a leading Bangladeshi labor organizer who led her first strike at 15; Han, who, as a teenager, began assembling circuit boards for an international electronics company based in Seoul; Albert, a copper miner in Zambia who, during a wage protest, was shot by representatives of the Chinese-owned mining company that he worked for; and Sanjay, who grew up in the shadow of the Bhopal chemical disaster, one of the worst industrial accidents in history. "A compelling message about the plight of labor workers worldwide...Hope for change comes in various forms throughout Goria's collection, including the strides made by Bangladesh worker Kalpona Akter, who, after years working in a textile mill, became a staunch activist and labor rights advocate. Their common trait, aside from a laborious livelihood, is a marked desire to initiate a movement to bar unreasonable and perilous working conditions and unfair wages. Goria dramatically acknowledges the legion of overlooked workers who 'produce the things we use every day,'expressed through the carefully chosen words of crusaders who share each other's individual hopes and hardships. Powerful and revealing testimony to the injustices of manual labor, infused with inspiration for global change." —Kirkus Reviews "Compiled and edited by lawyer Goria, these oral accounts of labor abuses and the struggles of the working poor cover most corners of the globalized economy. Stories from workers and labor activists in far-flung locations, including Mexico, Zambia, Bangladesh, China, and South Korea, convey a sobering uniformity of harsh working conditions, low wages, coerced labor, and ruthless retribution against unions and advocates for workers' rights. Readers hear from Bangladeshi garment workers who struggled to get monthly minimum wages raised from $15 in 1994 to $43 by 2010; Indian farmers trapped in a cycle of borrowing, debt, and bankruptcy; and the Chinese factory worker whose journey to the electronics manufacturing hub of Shenzhen started with excitement and ended with an accident that cost him a hand. A more hopeful strain about the resilience of labor emerges in some narratives: 'Never think that you're less than the boss,' counsels Ana Juarez, a Mexican garment worker and activist. As Kalpona Akter, a Bangladeshi labor rights advocate, says: 'It was hard for me to tell my story for this book and to make my life so public' but . . . 'if it lets another woman who has faced exploitation and repression feel that she is not alone, and even encourages her to speak up, then it is worth it.'" —Publishers Weekly "This book, edited by attorney Goria, uses oral history to introduce readers to 16 disadvantaged employees working in agriculture, the garment industry, natural resources, and electronics manufacturing in countries including India, Zambia, and the United States. These workers discuss their experiences with unsafe workplace conditions, organized labor, poor wages, and immigration. The interviews serve to educate readers about the working conditions of low-wage workers around the world and draw their attention to the challenges faced by employees toiling in less than desirable—and often unsafe—conditions. The book includes a time line of modern industrialization, a glossary, historical capsules providing context for the oral histories in the book, and an overview of the global decline of garment-industry wages. Readers interested in the plight of disadvantaged workers worldwide as well as the undesirable effects of globalization will be likewise interested in this book. VERDICT: Recommended for a wide range of readers, from those served by high school libraries and public and academic ones as well." —Nathan Rupp, Library Journal

Q: Limit on symbol table? I've been looking into some corner cases for loading python (2.7 on osx) files as configuration files. I wanted to see what the behavior was if I circularly ran execfile. I expected a out of memory error or a lot of swapping to occur, but I was rather surprised when I got a different result. I setup a test scenario as follows: 'd' python script with: #!/usr/bin/python x = 0 execfile("d1") 'd1' python script with: #!/usr/bin/python x += 1 print "x = %d" % x execfile("d2") 'd2' python script with: #!/usr/bin/python x += 1 print "x = %d" % x execfile("d1") The result: $ ./d x = 1 x = 2 x = 3 ... removed for brevity ... x = 997 x = 998 x = 999 Traceback (most recent call last): File "./d", line 5, in <module> execfile("d1") File "d1", line 5, in <module> execfile("d2") File "d2", line 5, in <module> execfile("d1") ... removed for brevity ... File "d1", line 5, in <module> execfile("d2") File "d2", line 5, in <module> execfile("d1") File "d1", line 5, in <module> execfile("d2") KeyError: 'unknown symbol table entry' I was just curious if there was someone who could explain what is happening here? Why does it stop after executing execfile ~1000 times? A: From the Python source code, Objects/dictobject.c: /* Note that, for historical reasons, PyDict_GetItem() suppresses all errors * that may occur (originally dicts supported only string keys, and exceptions * weren't possible). So, while the original intent was that a NULL return * meant the key wasn't present, in reality it can mean that, or that an error * (suppressed) occurred while computing the key's hash, or that some error * (suppressed) occurred when comparing keys in the dict's internal probe * sequence. A nasty example of the latter is when a Python-coded comparison * function hits a stack-depth error, which can cause this to return NULL * even if the key is present. */ So, PyDict_GetItem() does not always report errors correctly. Interesting... so in the following code in Python/symtable.c, v = PyDict_GetItem(st->st_blocks, k); if (v) { assert(PySTEntry_Check(v)); Py_INCREF(v); } else { PyErr_SetString(PyExc_KeyError, "unknown symbol table entry"); } Any error that occurs when looking up a symbol (including out-of-memory errors) will be turned into a KeyError. This is probably a bug.
Bully-boy pro lifers stake out prime minister's home - shameful tactics do nothing but fuel anger in abortion debate Daniel O'Carroll Enda Kenny: Irish Taoiseach target of aggressive abuse over abortion legislation. Pro life campaigners aggrieved at proposed legislation which would legalize abortion under limited circumstances have been mounting a vitriolic campaign of abuse against Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny in recent weeks. In doing so they have seriously undermined the cause they profess to serve and sustained images of a vigilante mob attempting to suppress dissenting views through crude intimidation. The latest in a series of disquieting incidents has seen masked men campaigning outside the Castlebar home of the Taoiseach while his wife and son were at home yesterday before being removed by police. Earlier that day, Kenny was repeatedly heckled as he tried to conduct an opening ceremony at a completely unrelated commemoration ceremony in County Longford where he faced charges that he was proposing to "kill the unborn" in supporting the Bill. Last week he disclosed to the Dáil how he had received letter written in blood, sarcastic medals, plastic fetuses, and medical scapulars as result of the legislation, now in draft stage, which would allow abortions to be performed where the mother's life was in imminent danger as a result of the pregnancy. Despite Kenny's fervent Catholicism, he has sustained his mantra that "my book is the Constitution" and has refused to back down in the face of the often unsavory methodologies being employed by those opposed to the passage of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill. Other politicians have been similarly inundated with phone calls from both legitimate pro-life lobbyists and more dubious vigilante crooks. One politician described the concerted effort as a programme of "widespread intimidation", saying that politicians had been spat at and people had been turning up at their homes at unusual hours in desperate attempts to convince them to vote against the proposals. One female TD, allegedly, received a threat that her throat would be cut. should she vote with the government. Each TD (member of parliament) is estimated to be receiving 50 telephone calls a week from those opposed to the idea -- a relatively vast volume in a country with a comparatively small tradition of organized political lobbying. Last December the communications regulator was forced to intervene after members of the public reported a spate of automated telephone calls beseeching them to lobby their TDs to oppose the Bill. The 'robo calls' were accompanied by graphic anti-abortion posters, some targeting individual TDs. Those opposing the legislation are usually referred to as the 'pro-life' movement and comprise a broad swathe of religious Catholic voters as well as those opposed to the idea of any kind of abortion on atheist moral grounds. They either argue that any kind of abortion is tantamount to murder or that the legislation is the first step on a road towards abortion on demand. 'Pro choice' activists, the legislation's proponents, support a woman's right to chose to have an abortion or not. The legislation represents the government's decision to legislate on the X case after the untimely demise of Savita Halappanavar. The hospital patient died of complications following doctors' refusal to grant her an abortion. While pro life activists' views resonate with a significant proportion of the population, even many of their supporters would question the propriety of intimidating members of the Taoiseach's family at their private home. On the rare occasions where protests do take place outside a politician's family dwelling -- such as a similar anti-abortion demonstration outside Justice Minister Alan Shatter's private residence -- they are usually roundly condemned; I believe rightly so. Making a case against abortion is a perfectly legitimate activity and on such a divisive issue was guaranteed to happen. But resorting to the kind of sustained intimidation leveled against public representatives in recent weeks generates endless negative PR for the pro-life campaign and casts them in the prototypical role of agents of the controlling Catholic church which dominated the Ireland of yesteryear. Leader of the opposition party Fianna Fáil's decision to remove his party's whip system for the vote (effectively, allowing TDs to vote with their conscience and contravene party policy without the prospect of consequences) was an inspired move which removes personal responsibility accruing to TDs and ensures that they won't be forced to compromise their religious beliefs on the issue. Hopefully the party's representatives as well as those voting along party lines can cast their ballot without having suffered through such abuse. (Correction: Subsequent to this post being sent for publication, a fathers' rights group, not affiliated with the pro life movement, claimed responsibility for the protest.)

This week's portion, Shimini, carries us deeper into the book of Leviticus. The first half of the portion is the initiation of the sacrificial cult: the Torah describes in dramatic fashion the first sacrifices Aaron and his sons carry out in their role as priests. They slaughter various animals corresponding to the different types of offerings, they splatter blood on the altar and fire consumes the corpses. Aaron and his sons then bless the people and the people fall on their faces. The second half of the portion is an explication of the dietary laws. We are told specifically which animals are kosher and which are not: we learn that kosher land animals have cloven hooves and are ruminants, kosher birds are not birds of prey and kosher sea creatures have fins and scales. We also learn some other regulations as to what may or may not be eaten. There are many questions raised by this short passage, but we can understand from the text that Nadav and Avihu did something wrong, and they were punished for their transgression. Put in context with the passage that came before, we can have an understanding of what perhaps their transgression was. The Torah says they offered "alien fire, which God had not enjoined upon them." Earlier in the parasha, when describing the initial sacrifices, the Torah says, at various times, "this is what God has commanded," and "according to regulation" and "as Moses had commanded." What the Torah is telling us is that while the first set of sacrifices was what was commanded, what Nadav and Avihu offered was not. Essentially what they were doing was offering a sacrifice that was outside the norm of the ordained and organized system of sacrifices. It seems very extreme, though. Did they really deserve death for a slight deviation from the norm? And besides, is what they did so wrong? It can be argued that what Nadav and Avihu did when they offered the additional sacrifice was to further glorify God—they were not offering something in contradistinction to, but rather in addition to, what was proscribed, due to their zeal, or desire to serve, or love of Torah. This may be, but what perhaps the Torah is trying to teach us in this story is the perils of individualism. The extreme nature of the story aside—and this isn't the first time a story in the Torah is extreme it its details—the Torah is showing us that by branching off on their own Nadav and Avihu were violating their communal responsibility and trust to the detriment of the whole. They system of sacrifices for the entire Israelite community was set. In making their own offering outside these norms, Nadav and Avihu were placing their own desires above the norms of the community. They were acting in their own self-interest. But for Nadav and Avihu, who were leaders and priests, it can't just be about them. It has to be about the whole. This mindset does not just fall upon our leaders, but upon all of us who live in community. When we fail to take into account our communal responsibility, and we privilege ourselves over others, we privilege individualism over communalism, we weaken our social bonds. Individualism is different than individuality. We are of course all individuals, we have our own likes and dislikes, ideas and dreams, needs and desires. We make our own choices and set our own path. But we do not live in a vacuum, we are part of a communal whole. We pursue our own paths within the context of others, and we have a responsibility and obligation to keep the needs and desires of others in mind as we seek to fulfill our own needs and desires. In our day this can take many forms. The recent outbreak of measles at Disneyland brought the issue of vaccinations—and those who opt-out—to the fore. Locally the issue led to the public revelation of vaccination rates, and Yohanna and I discovered that Erez's elementary school had one of the highest unvaccinated rates. This was startling and unnerving. I don't need to get into issues of "herd immunity" or scientific detail, but to simply say that vaccines work because we all agree to use them. They are part of a social contract—we agree to abide by certain guidelines when we live in community, and when we privilege the self over the other—individualism over communalism—then we violate that contract. Yes, we need to honor the individuality of each person, and do what we can to support those individual journeys. But we need to be mindful so that individuality does not become individualism. Nadav and Avihu broke the rules. There are times we go must outside the box, and we need to do things differently. There are times we must think creatively, and we need to challenge the existing norms. But we must ask, to what end? If it is to serve others and a greater good, then that is something we should pursue. But if it is to serve our own self interest at the expense of others, then, as in the case of Nadav and Avihu, it is a transgression and there will be consequences.

This beautiful DIY Citrus Mint hand soap is made with essential oils and makes a great gift! So who says that soap needs to be purely utilitarian? I don't know about you, but when it comes to my hand soap, I am drawn to two key things; scent and packaging, hands down. I have always been a packaging junkie and just a sucker for beautiful design. I love to go to stores and just look at all of the different ways companies have branded their products. I pay special attention to the colors, patterns and textures of the paper used. I think it's the marketer in me or maybe I'm just a geek… there's that. One other important area that we just can't avoid is the topic of chemicals. Yes, those nasty chemicals that have found their way into all of our health and beauty products. Do you remember the antibacterial craze? OMG! It was like the companies and the media were telling us to live in a sterile bubble. It was so bad that people were ready to go add a hazmat suit to their daily wardrobe. There were antibacterial soaps, wipes, you name it. We became this germophobe society where "pass the Purell" became a thing at every social event. So why is all this so bad? Well you see, we need our immune systems to keep us healthy, and by over using all of these antibacterial products, we start to kill those natural fighters in our bodies. Last year the FDA finally announced that there was not enough scientific evidence to show that over-the-counter antibacterial soaps were better at preventing illness than washing with plain soap and water. If you want to find out more about the nasty chemicals, just google Triclosan, but make sure you are sitting down when you read about what types of chemicals have been allowed in our products. It is not pretty! Well enough of being a Debbie downer. Let's get on with the good stuff. This hand soap could not be easier to make with just a hand full of ingredients, that won't compromise your immune system. We will be scenting our soap with essential oils which not only smell amazing, but have some great health benefits. I spoke about essential oils in my Essential Oils 101 post. This is a awesome place to start, especially if you are new to essential oils. For this blend, I chose peppermint, lemon, lemongrass and tea tree essential oils. I love the citrusy aroma of the lemon and the lemongrass, paired with the peppermint, and the tea tree acts as an antibacterial. I like the addition of a little almond or jojoba oil to the blend to make sure that the soap doesn't dry out our hands. I mean, I live in MN so we do not need any extra dryness to our hands, especially in the winter. So let's talk about these labels. Aren't they lovely? I made them especially for you….awe. You can print them here Citrus Mint Hand Soap Label. I couldn't give you a recipe for this great soap and leave you with some boring labeless vessel to put it in. Remember, it's all about the packaging. If you go the label route, you're definitely going to want to make sure you waterproof them, so please see the instructions in the recipe card found at the bottom of this post. You don't want to spend time making this beautiful handmade loveliness and then one pump of the soap and your ink has runneth away. I always make a couple extra bottles when I make a batch, because you never know when you need a quick last minute hostess gift. Pair this soap with a couple of nice dish or hand towels in a pretty basket and you have a fabulous, stylish, handmade gift. Who doesn't love something handmade? This luxurious, DIY hand soap is made with essential oils, is easy to make, and makes a great gift. Place water and liquid soap in a glass container with a spout. Mix together until blended. Add essential oils and almond/jojoba oil. Blend until combined. Pour into glass jar with pump. Remove label from backing and attach to your pump bottle. If the ingredients become slightly separated, tilt the bottle a couple of times before pumping. Carla – will this work with a foam soap pump? I have not tried this in a foaming soap pump. The pump bottle will need to be glass since the essential oils can erode plastic over time. Let me know if you try it. I would love to hear how it turns out. Works in a foam pump. What size glass pump bottle? The bottle is an 8oz. size. Thanks for the question. I updated the blog post to reflect the size.

For more information about this message, please visit this page: About CDC.gov Lab safety report on Ebola virus transfer Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.). Office of the Director. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting today that a small amount of material from an Ebola virus experiment that was securely transported from a Select‐Agent‐approved BSL‐4 lab to a Select‐Agent‐ approved BSL‐2 lab may have contained live virus. The material was on a sealed plate but should not have been moved into the BSL‐2 laboratory. We cannot rule out possible exposure of the one laboratory technician who worked with the material in the BSL‐2 laboratory. There was no possible exposure outside the secure laboratory at CDC and no exposure or risk to the public. The event was discovered by the laboratory scientists yesterday, December 23, and reported to leadership within an hour of the discovery. The event is under internal investigation by CDC, was reported to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell, and reporting to the internal and national Select Agent Programs has been initiated. CDC will provide a report on the event when the investigation concludes. The BSL‐2 laboratory area had already been decontaminated and the material destroyed as a routine procedure before the error was identified. The laboratory was decontaminated for a second time, and is now closed and transfers from the BSL‐4 lab have been stopped while the review is taking place. "I am troubled by this incident in our Ebola research laboratory in Atlanta," said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. "We are monitoring the health of one technician who could possibly have been exposed and I have directed that there be a full review of every aspect of the incident and that CDC take all necessary measures. Thousands of laboratory scientists in more than 150 labs throughout CDC have taken extraordinary steps in recent months to improve safety. No risk to staff is acceptable, and our efforts to improve lab safety are essential ‐‐the safety of our employees is our highest priority." CDC will continue to provide support during the Ebola epidemic through its research and diagnostic lab work. Skilled lab scientists in the Ebola response are valued contributors to ending this epidemic. Based on what was learned during the lab science and safety reviews earlier this year, CDC has taken several immediate actions in this incident including closure of the laboratory, notification of staff, initiation of a complete internal review, and notifications of regulatory oversight agencies. This review will give us a clear understanding of what happened in this case and what can be done to further improve laboratory safety. CDC has established a CDC‐wide single point of accountability for laboratory science and safety and this will aid in ensuring accountability in this situation. CDC will also report this event to its external advisory committee which provides ongoing advice and direction for laboratory science and safety.

In buildings containing flats or in housing developments where there are private areas used in common and not owned by specific properties, the cost of maintaining those areas needs to be recovered. With flats these charges are called 'service charges' and in housing developments they are called 'rent charges'. The maintenance is usually organised by a third party, such as a landlord or a management company. Usually an estimate as to the charge is given at the beginning of a pre-defined year and a payment on account made. At the end of the year, accounts are produced and balancing credits or additional payments made. The service charge costs can be significant and you need to consider this when purchasing. You need to consider the history of payments and future payments. Buildings with flat roofs or lifts can produce particularly high service charges.

By now, fans may have heard Slaughterhouse's stadium anthem track and next single, "My Life," featuring Cee Lo Green on the hook. Well, XXL recently asked the four-man contingent, consisting of Crooked I, Joell Ortiz, Joe Budden and Royce Da 5'9" how the Cee Lo assist came out for the second single off their Shady Records debut LP, Welcome To: Our House, due June 12. "Yeah man, Cee Lo owed me a favor from way back," Joe Budden joked and laughed. Goodie Mob probably feels the same. Cee Lo, a permanent vocal coach on the NBC reality show, The Voice, reunited with Goodie Mob, his longtime crew, for a performance on the mainstream American show last month. That performance came months after he shared the worldwide Super Bowl XLVI halftime stage with Madonna in February. Of course, Cee Lo isn't the only big assist that Slaughterhouse is getting on Welcome to: Our House. Eminem has taken a very hands-on approach for this project, the group's second overall album, but Shady Records debut.
Will the Truck/Van Gas Transfer system void my vehicle factory warranty? No, it will not void your vehicle warranty. Is the Truck/Van Gas Transfer system a permanent installation? Yes the system is meant to be permanently installed, however it can easily be removed and installed onto another vehicle if needed. What kind of flow can I expect from the Truck/Van Gas Transfer system? Since the system relies on the vehicles fuel pump the flow will be directly determined by the factory fuel pump that is on your vehicle. The majority of vehicles we have tested will flow over 1 gallon per minute. What should I do if the Truck/Van Gas Transfer System causes my vehicle to stall when I use it? Although this situation is very rare, you can prevent your vehicle from stalling by adjusting the Flow Valve on the back of the unit. Instead of turning this valve all the way open you can try opening it only ½ to ¾ of the way. Is the Truck/Van Gas Transfer system PT500 approved for use in California and other EPA regulated States? Yes this system has been approved for sale in California and all EPA regulated states. Can the Truck/Van Gas Transfer system be used with Diesel? No this system is designed to only work on gasoline applications. How do I know if the PT500 Truck/Van Gas Transfer System will work with my vehicle? The system was designed to work on any Fuel Injected Truck or Van that has factory installed quick disconnect Fuel Lines. Most trucks from the Late 1990's and newer have these connections. If you are not sure you can take a look at your vehicle Fuel Line to see if it is equipped with quick disconnects. Will the MC100 Motorcycle sharing system work on my motorcycle? The system uses the factory quick disconnect fuel lines on 2001 and Newer Fuel-Injected Harley Davidson bikes; therefore it will only connect to those motorcycles. However you can still pump fuel into any brand motorcycle as long as the host bike is a Fuel Injected Harley. Is the MC100 Motorcycle sharing system a permanent installation? No, the systems uses quick disconnects which allows it to be installed and removed in just seconds. After use just simply pack the system away in the provided storage pouch. What should I do if there is fuel leaking from where I connected the MC100 system to my motorcycle? First turn off the motorcycle and remove the MC100 system. Take a look up inside the motorcycles factory quick disconnect check valve and inspect the lower O-Ring. The majority of the time this O-Ring will be dried up or damaged from the Ethanol in fuels available today that eat away at the factory O-Rings. We sell replacement Viton O-Rings (MC200-5) or entire check valve rebuild kits (MC300) on our website which include everything you need to rebuild your factory check valve. I am using the MC400 Check Valve Repair Tools and keep bending the hooks, what am I doing wrong? If you are bending the hooks it is mostly likely caused by applying too much pressure when inserting the tool up into the Check Valve. Try to apply only a slight amount of pressure while rotating the handle with the hook clockwise. You will feel the hook grab the O-Ring and then at this point you can pull straight down and the O-Ring should come right out. This may take a few tries to get the proper feel. If you need replacement Hooks please feel free to contact us.
Mumbai: It's a sultry, smoggy afternoon, and Shivaji Sakaram Sawant is looking a little flustered. A slight 57-year-old from the nearby village of Colaba, Sawant is in his 30th year as a dabbawala ("one who carries the box"), part of an army of white-clad men who deliver about 200,000 homecooked lunches to Mumbai's workers each day. Since the 1890s, dabbawalas have navigated this city's crowded, chaotic streets, riding heavy bicycles with lunch tins—picked up from various workers' homes—dangling from the handlebars. Endurance is vital, as is an encyclopedic knowledge of the city: Mumbai's dabbawalas are said to make one error per 6 million deliveries, and any deviation from this rate is not taken lightly. The traffic, as ever, is terrible, but the car eventually glides to a stop at the set of a Bollywood musical. Followed by a videographer, Sawant hands food to the young dancers, punctuating his delivery with the same courteous bow he always offers his customers. And that's that. The camera is switched off. The tins are handed back. Sawant leaves the set quietly, on foot, heading off to catch the crowded train that will take him home.

Why Hire A Trial Attorney? Ohio Supreme Court: Warrantless search of student backpack was OK On behalf of The Law Offices of Saia & Piatt, Inc. | May 18, 2017 | Criminal Defense If a high school student leaves his backpack on the bus, would it be fair for him or her to expect it to be left unopened? Would it put anyone in danger? What if there was a rumor the student was a gang member? These are the questions the Ohio Supreme Court recently answered in the case of a Columbus high school student who was charged with possession of a deadly weapon after leaving his bag unattended on a bus. A little background: The U.S. Supreme Court had already found in the 1991 case of Florida v. Bostick that bag searches on buses are constitutionally doubtful in the best of circumstances. However, that differs somewhat from the one heard by the Ohio Supreme Court. Moreover, students have less privacy rights than adults. Couldn't any unattended bag contain a bomb? According to the Courthouse News Service, on one February morning in 2013, a student left his backpack on a bus. A school security guard found it and opened it only enough to identify its probable owner. Based on a rumor that the student was a gang member, however, he brought the backpack to the school principal instead of returning it to the student. The school principal felt free to empty the bag, and inside they found bullets. The pair then contacted a police officer. The principal, the security guard and the police officer confronted the student in a hallway, where the police officer executed a take-down and incapacitated the student. They then searched another bag the student had on his person. Inside there was a gun. The student was charged with possession of a deadly weapon, and argued that these searches were unreasonable — and therefore illegal under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He asked for the evidence to be suppressed, and both the trial court and the Franklin County Appeals Court agreed. The Ohio Supreme Court disagreed and sent his case back to trial. First, the court reaffirmed that schools are "special needs" settings that allow more warrantless searches than would be allowed for adults. Next, they reasoned that at each step, the child's right to privacy was outweighed by the "In compelling governmental interest in protecting public-school students from physical harm." After all, they reasoned, any unattended bag could contain a tiny explosive device fashioned out of carbon dioxide cartridges called a 'cricket bomb' like those attempted by the Columbine High School shooters. Such a bomb might not be noticed in a cursory search meant merely to identify the owner of the bag. Under circumstances like those — however unlikely they might seem — surely the search was reasonable?

Community Oversight Board chair: Fixing police body cam issue 'as important as living and breathing' Nashville's Community Oversight Board wants body and dash cameras on the streets as soon as possible, even amidst the budget crisis facing city leaders. Community Oversight Board chair: Fixing police body cam issue 'as important as living and breathing' Nashville's Community Oversight Board wants body and dash cameras on the streets as soon as possible, even amidst the budget crisis facing city leaders. Check out this story on Tennessean.com: https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2019/12/10/nashville-community-oversight-board-police-body-cameras/2633823001/ Mariah Timms, Nashville Tennessean Published 5:00 a.m. CT Dec. 10, 2019 | Updated 3:56 p.m. CT Dec. 10, 2019 Even under the strain of a budget crisis, the Community Oversight Board plans to continue its push for body cameras on all Nashville police officers as soon as possible. "It's not enough anymore to say you don't have the money. This is important as living and breathing in this city," COB chair Ashlee Davis said Monday. "That's how important this is. That's not OK." The board plans to issue a formal policy recommendation soon explaining their focus on transparency, as well as urging other departments to research possibly less expensive ways to store data and effectively use labor in processing video. The board's executive team met Monday afternoon to assess a draft version of the recommendation they plan to issue to other stakeholders. The board, which was established via a 2018 referendum approved by Nashville voters, is tasked with investigating allegations of police misconduct. The board also can recommend policy changes for the department. Body, dash cameras on hold A day after the board meeting, Mayor John Cooper announced plans to roll out a limited number of body cameras in 2020 while policy and cost questions are answered. The city pulled back from a department-wide roll out last month amid a budget crisis and concerns over a mounting price tag. Cooper's policy director John Buntin said it could cost more than $40 million per year to operate the cameras and analyze their footage, which he said was "deeply concerning" in the midst of a budget shortfall. The delay has been tied to the state comptroller's urgent report to city leaders in November that Nashville was running out of money to pay its bills. The comptroller said officials must close a $41 million budget gap, or the state would take over the city's coffers. The police department has about $10 million set aside to buy cameras, which have been a city priority since 2016. But city leaders have not decided how to handle millions in additional funds that could be needed as the body camera footage makes its way through the rest of the criminal justice system. Downstream costs could come from outside the mayor's office and MNPD; prosecutors and public defenders said they'll need funding to review thousands of hours of footage that becomes relevant in criminal cases. Monday's board meeting also included an update on the progress of the so-called Negotiation Task Force set up to allow representatives from the COB, mayor's office and MNPD to meet and negotiate the draft Memorandum of Understanding between the COB and MNPD. Although the COB representative to the task force, Phyllis Hildreth, was not present at the meeting, due to being out of town, board member Matthew Sweeney confirmed the task force is making progress on discussing the articles of the MOU. Also not present Monday was the board staff's newly-appointed Executive Director Jill Fitcheard, who was tied up at another meeting, the board was informed. Fitcheard was named the new director last week after the unexpected resignation of William Weeden, announced Nov. 18. Davis confirmed Monday that Fitcheard's salary would be updated to reflect her new position, effective as of the day last week she was named to the role. "I have had a conversation with Director Fitcheard since our last meeting. I wanted to ensure she has all the support she needs," Davis said. "Mrs. Fitcheard's commitment to the mission and purpose of the Community Oversight Board, and most importantly to the Nashville community, is unparalleled and her leadership has been instrumental to the success and continuity of the COB's efforts," Davis said in a statement last week. "The COB congratulates her on this deserving appointment and looks forward to this continued work and progress with her as our Executive Director." Includes reporting by Adam Tamburin.

Q: print dictionary keys and values in one column in tcl I am new learner of tcl scripting language. I am using TCL version 8.5. I read text file through tcl script and count similar words frequency. I used for loop and dictionary to count similar words and their frequency but output of the program print like this: alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 1 delta 1 But I want to print it in one column each key, value pair of dictionary or we could say each key, value pair print line by line in output. Following is my script in tcl and its output at the end. set f [open input.txt] set text [read $f] foreach word [split $text] { dict incr words $word } puts $words Output of the above script: alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 1 delta 1 A: You would do: dict for {key value} $words { puts "$key $value" } When reading the dict documentation, take care about which subcommands require a dictionaryVariable (like dict incr) and which require a dictionaryValue (like dict for) For nice formatting, as suggested by Donal, here's a very terse method: set maxWid [tcl::mathfunc::max {*}[lmap w [dict keys $words] {string length $w}]] dict for {word count} $words {puts [format "%-*s = %s" $maxWid $word $count]} Or, look at the source code for the parray command for further inspiration: parray tcl_platform ;# to load the proc info body parray
Q: ReactiveCocoa - observing isFirstResponder property and UITextField with clearsOnBeginEditing set to YES I am new to ReactiveCocoa, but I think it's very nice and outstanding technique for reducing code complexity. I just started experiencing with the framework, and not everything is clear for me at the moment, so excuse me if my problem can be solved in some obvious way. In my app I have login view controller with simple form contains two text fields (username and password) and a button. I would like the button to be disabled if any of two text fields is empty. So, I wrote this code: RAC(self.loginButton, enabled) = [RACSignal combineLatest:@[self.userTextField.rac_textSignal, self.passwordTextField.rac_textSignal] reduce:^(NSString *username, NSString *password) { BOOL valid = (username.length > 0 && password.length > 0); return @(valid); }]; It's very simple and it's working. The problem is that one of my text fields (the password field) has secureTextEntry and clearsOnBeginEditing properties set to YES. I will try to explain unwanted behavior that I am experiencing with this configuration: Let's assume that both username and password fields are NOT empty. In this case the button is enabled. When user taps on password field, it becomes first responder (keyboard appears and user can enter his password), but because of clearsOnBeginEditing being set to YES for that field, the previously entered password is cleared from the text field. That's way password field is now empty. The problem is that signal is not being sent, so the button remains enabled, despite the password field is empty. My first idea to solve this issue (well, more like workaround solution) was to observe isFirstResponder property on password field beside observing text changes. That's way the block that checks if button should be enabled would be called when password field becomes first responder. I don't know if this solution works, because I have no idea how to implement it using ReactiveCocoa. I have looking for creating a signal for isFirstResponder property changes, but without a luck. It might be not the best approach in order to solve this issue, but nothing comes to my mind at this point. Then, the question is: how to observe isFirstResponder property with ReactiveCocoa? And more general question: how to observe text field's text changes when clearsOnBeginEditing is set to YES? UPDATE: I found out that I can create signal for UIControlEventEditingDidBegin event that should give me substitution of observing isFirstResponder property changes: [self.passwordTextField rac_signalForControlEvents:UIControlEventEditingDidBegin] Unfortunately this does not solve the issue. Now I understand that field is cleared AFTER it becomes first responder, and clearing field automatically after it becomes first responder does not send signal for text changes. That's way when validation block is executed it still thinks that password field is not empty, and the button remains enabled despite password field was cleared and it's empty. A: Unfortunately the -rac_textSignal only listens for UIControlEventEditingChanged. If UIControlEventEditingDidBegin were added, you'd be all set. I suppose you could patch this into it and submit a pull request? - (RACSignal *)rac_textSignal { @weakify(self); return [[[[[RACSignal defer:^{ @strongify(self); return [RACSignal return:self]; }] concat:[self rac_signalForControlEvents:UIControlEventEditingChanged|UIControlEventEditingDidBegin]] map:^(UITextField *x) { return x.text; }] takeUntil:self.rac_willDeallocSignal] setNameWithFormat:@"%@ -rac_textSignal", [self rac_description]]; }

Riverside Youth Theatre (RYT) was started in 1982 to provide opportunities for young people aged between 12 and 18 who have an interest in drama. Members can join the acting team or the technical, and many members choose to experience both. Productions range from period costume drama to musicals and are always demanding.We aim to encourage an interest and develop skills and experience in all aspects of theatre. Actors experience auditions, rehearsals and the staging of real productions which are presented to live audiences. The technical team learn about lighting, sound and set building, and are involved in the rehearsals and live performances.
Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker says he's satisfied with the rollout of the state's first recreational marijuana retail stores. "I think it's gone what I would describe, I guess, as mostly according to plan, which is a good thing," Baker told MassLive. Two stores, Cultivate in Leicester and New England Treatment Access (NETA) in Northampton, opened on Nov. 20, the first retail pot shops east of the Mississippi. The Cannabis Control Commission released figures Tuesday showing consumers spent $2.2 million at the two shops over their first five days operation, as Leicester residents complained of traffic problems. The Worcester county town's police chief, James Hurley, told residents at a Monday night emergency meeting that novelty of the new pot shop will eventually fade away. The five-member commission and the new agency's staffers are processing applications for additional retail shops across the state. "I think obviously for the commission this is the beginning and I'm anticipating that they'll learn as they go and if they need to make adjustments, they will," Baker said after an unrelated holiday event at Faneuil Hall. "But as I've said before, I thought the fact that they were deliberate in their approach to the rollout was the right way to pursue it." Recreational marijuana sales begin last week at two stores in Massachusetts, the first to open on the East Coast. Baker, who opposed marijuana legalization when the issue was on the 2016 ballot, said drugged driving remains his "biggest concern." "It's very important that people recognize and appreciate the fact that this is not something they should be doing if they're planning to be driving," Baker said, pointing to ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, as well as public transportation. "I just hope people take that part seriously," he said. In a public awareness campaign on impaired driving, Massachusetts public safety officials sought to equate operating a motor vehicle under the influence of marijuana with doing so under the influence of alcohol.

These demos are of songs that we put together originally planned to follow up The Fateful Dark with, some of the ideas ended up getting used, but none of them used as they were recorded here. We made these demos at Satellite Studios in Enfield, North London. (the same room where the Channel 4 thing happened). I think it's obvious we were listening to waaayyyy too much Iron Maiden.

Why You Should Take a Wilderness First Aid Course By Ben Lerman on 3/21/19 8:12 AM NOLS Wilderness Medicine student practices caring for a patient in the outdoors. Photo by Jared Steinman. You love the outdoors. The beauty. The adventure. The chance to unplug. The quality time with family and friends, or even by yourself. Whether you choose to explore the wilds by hiking, on the water, with a fishing rod in hand, or up a mountain road with your camper, the remoteness and rawness of it all is likely part of the appeal.

Those involved respond in all manner of ways, from trying to photograph and identify the snakes' species in 2006's Snakes on a Plane to cutting open the bite wound and attempting to suck out the poison in 2010's True Grit. Needless to say, these sensationalized portrayals can be misleading. Topics: WFR, first aid, wilderness medicine, myth, snakebite Shock: What Causes It and What To Do Photo by Mike Trewartha.

FIFA Women's World Cup 2019 final, USA VS Netherlands: Where to watch it live By Ishan Ghosh July 7, 2019 18:43 +08 USA and Netherlands are going to face each other in the final Twitter The United States team will face Netherlands in the final of the FIFA Women's World Cup 2019 on July 7 at the Lon Olympic stadium in France. USA came into the final defeating England 2-1 whereas Netherlands entered the final courtesy a 1-0 win over Sweden. Preview, prediction, schedule The three-time world champions USA are coming into the final riding high on a hard fought win against England. They have been in magnificent form throughout the tournament and have not lost a single match. However, their star player and probably the player of the tournament Megan Rapinoe was out of the semi-final clash due to a hamstring injury. But the USA team management have announced that she will be fit for the final. The loss of such a big player would have been a major setback for the team. With her in the team, they will be looking forward to adding another trophy to their collection. On the other hand, Netherlands who are now oozing with confidence after qualifying for the final, came into the cup decider by beating Sweden in a hard fought 1-0 win. The sole goal of the match came in the 99th minute. The 2017 European champions will be hoping that their star player Lieke Martens performs up to her usual high standard and gets fit for the final. She was one of the reasons behind the 2017 triumph so her presence will be very vital for the Orange Brigade. The USA definitely have the upper hand over first time finalist Netherlands and are, definitely, the favourite to win. But Netherlands, who have been unbeaten for the last 12 matches, will not let them win easily. An exciting match is on the cards. The USA-Netherlands match will start at 5 PM on July 7 according to local time and 11 pm, July 7 according to SGT.

Creating beautiful art works is a passion of mine, and has come in many different forms over the years. I used to watch my grandmother create beautiful oil paintings and knew that was what I wanted to do. Returning to drawing the beautiful old buildings of Tasmania I am pleased to produce pen and ink drawings and acrylic paintings. I have also wandered into print making and have a selection of mannequin fashion and tea cup collograph prints. The love of old things, has me scouring the countryside and antique shops for old items of interest. I can never pass an old door or window without taking a photo. As my artwork evolves, I am trying new mediums, and mixed media has become a new passion. I have also just started in some pastel work. I tend to now look at a subject and then decide which medium would suit it best – a new development in my creative process.

World War I Has Lessons for Today World War I began with the smallest of incidents and turned into one of the most complex of global events, a lesson that should be heeded today, according to a panel of historians gathered at the Association of the U.S. Army on the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry into "the war to end all wars." In 1914, the world was stable when Archduke Franz Ferdinand, presumptive heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was assassinated in Bosnia. That "small event" launched the great war in Europe, said Michael S. Neiberg, chair of war studies in the Department of National Security and Strategy at the U.S. Army War College. And once war begins, "it can be virtually impossible to get out." It took several years for the U.S. to agree to join the war, with politics playing a major role in that hesitation, Neiberg said. Once Congress agreed to enter the war on April 6, 1917, the U.S. military was unable to deploy quickly and took a year to be effective in Europe, he said. Among the myths of the war is that the U.S. Army resisted working under French and British command, said Edward Lengel, chief historian of the White House Historical Association. In fact, "amalgamation" was happening by November 1917, "but the collaboration was not an easy one," he said. The U.S. Army proved to be exceptionally adaptable as the war went on, he said. The April 6 discussion was co-hosted by AUSA and the Center for Military Diplomatic History, which promotes the application of history to contemporary problems.

Q: cannot resolve method getText() I'm new to Android developing and I'm trying to create a TODO list similar to an online tutorial I'm following. Everything but "todoText.setText(todoList.get(position).getText());" compiles correctly. With that line, I get the following error message: "cannot resolve method getText()." This is part of a class responsible for displaying each list row in a TODO checklist: @Override public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) { LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater) context.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE); View rowView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.activity_main, parent, false); TextView todoText = (TextView) rowView.findViewById(R.id.todoText); todoText.setText(todoList.get(position).getText()); return rowView; } I have no idea how to fix this. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. A: Hard to say without seeing todoList declaration, but chances are that todoList is a List of Strings (or something else but a TextView). If that's the case, you may just need to do.- todoText.setText(todoList.get(position)); A: I have no idea about the contents of your todoList but you can do a workaround if the content is not a String by using .toString() Try to change the code into - todoText.setText(todoList.get(position).toString()); hope it works.
Subject matter eligibility jurisprudence under 35 U.S.C. § 101 has been in flux in recent years, following the Supreme Court's decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank. On February 26, 2019, the Federal Circuit in University of Florida Research Foundation v. General Electric (available at: http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-1284.Opinion.2-26-2019.pdf ) held that the challenged claim(s) directed to systems and methods for compiling patient physiologic data from hospital bedside machines were invalid under § 101 as failing steps 2A and 2B under Alice/Mayo. While the decision represents the first Federal Circuit opinion since the publication of the USPTO's recent guidance addressing invalidity under 35 U.S.C. § 101, it does not specifically address that guidance, neither adopting the two-prong analysis nor rejecting it. Additionally, some may argue that the court's opinion appears inconsistent with training documents used by the USPTO regarding similar claims. Vibram – seller of the "FiveFinger" shoes – took an intellectual property insurance coverage dispute to the highest court of Massachusetts, and won. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that the insurers must pay Vibram's cost of defending a lawsuit brought by the family of the late marathoner, Abebe Bikila. Bikila earned his fame by winning the 1960 Olympic marathon barefoot. The underlying lawsuit stemmed from Vibram's use of the Bikila name for some models of its "toed" shoes. According to the court, Vibram's use of the Bikila name constituted use of another's "advertising idea," covered by the policies. The heirs of Abebe Bikila's estate brought the underlying action against Vibram in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. The family alleged a number of claims all stemming from Vibram's use of Bikila's name, including violation of the Washington Personality Rights and the Washington Consumer Protection Acts, false designation of origin and unfair competition under the Lanham Act, and unjust enrichment. Vibram tendered defense of the case to its insurers.

Posts tagged "monkey island" Swinging the spotlight over on the recently released special editions of Secret of Monkey Island and Return to Monkey Island! I just finished re-playing through Secret of Monkey Island, and I must say – what a fun time! The new graphics are fantastic, and the game has a nifty hotkey (It was F10 for me on PC) that takes you back and forth from new graphics to old 1990's gameplay. There are lots of major upgrades, like a re-done soundtrack and voice acting added to the new game. As far as graphics go, I'm really happy with the way it was done. The game looked like a painting most of the time, and it kept with the same feel that I remember when I played this more than 10 years ago on MSDOS. A lot of things were also added, such as random skulls in the sky forming clouds and what not, but it didn't take away from the overall feel of it, because it's got the same art style we saw in Monkey Island 3: Curse of Monkey Island. I know I've said it before, I find these Monkey Island games to be absolutely hilarious, and I'm very happy to see that LucasArts is bringing back the first 2 in the best way. It felt like I was playing the game for the first time again. The best part was, if I needed to remember something the old way, there was the hotkey. Another point, Monkey Island games have been cross-platform for a while, but I'll mention it here anyway: The Special Editions are cross-platform! Now you can play them via PSN, PC..even your iPhone. I strongly recommend anyone reading this that enjoys a fun puzzle game every now and then to at least download the demo's available for these new games!

Morocco eliminates Spain on penalties in the round of 16 of the World Cup Home » Morocco eliminates Spain on penalties in the round of 16 of the World Cup December 6, 2022December 6, 2022 The match: 0-0 (3-0 on penalties) Walid Regragui's Morocco achieved a historic feat on Tuesday by qualifying for the quarter-finals of the World Cup. A first in the history of the Atlas Lions who eliminated Spain after a penalty shootout completely missed by La Roja (0-0, 3-0 on pens). Moroccans could have had big regrets after the three big opportunities harvested by Walid Cheddira (see elsewhere) at the end of the game but they finally succeeded better in their shots on goal than the Spaniards. If Badr Benoun, third shooter, missed his attempt, Abdelhamid Sabiri, Hakim Ziyech and especially Achraf Hakimi – who managed a daring Panenka – allowed Morocco to join the next round. On the Spanish side, neither Pablo Sarabia, nor Carlos Soler, nor Sergio Busquets managed to deceive Yassine Bounou, the Moroccan goalkeeper, who stopped two out of three shots, the first failing on the post. Dominant throughout the game (76.8% ball possession), Spain never knew how to be effective. Luis Enrique's men had to wait until the 54th minute to target their first shot, a shot from Olmo deflected by Bounou. The Moroccans defended courageously and intelligently, trying to take advantage of Spain's losses to launch counterattacks. They could have cracked at the end of extra time, but success was on their side even if they lost Nayef Aguerd to injury (85th) and their captain Romain Saïss, hit in the left thigh, finished on one leg. Canada scorer (2-1) and some Belgium (2-0) in the previous round, Morocco, which conceded only one goal in four matches, will face the winner of Portugal-Switzerland (this Tuesday, 8 p.m.) to try to integrate the last four. The player: Cheddira, missed opportunities Coming in the 82nd minute in place of Selim Amallah, Walid Cheddira had several chances to open the scoring for Morocco. First there was this pivot shot too soft to deceive Unai Simon (86th). He was then caught by Aymeric Laporte in the Spanish area when he had been perfectly launched by Sofyan Amrabat (94th) at the start of extra time. Found by Ounahi, he lost a new duel against Simon (104th) before being taken over by Rodri in the area when Amrabat had still ideally launched him (115th). The fact: Sarabia, the failed entry In the 118th minute, Luis Enrique made the bet to replace Nico Williams – who came on in the 76th minute in place of the mediocre Ferran Torres – to start Pablo Sarabia for the penalty shootout. During his half hour spent on the lawn, Williams had nevertheless shown desire and beautiful things with the ball at his feet. After finding the post at the very end of extra time following a cross from Pedri (120th + 3), the PSG striker presented himself as the first Spanish shooter during the penalty shootout and again hit the post. Morocco is the 4th African team to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup after Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002 and Ghana in 2010. (Opta) Morocco coach Walid Regragui has become the first ever African coach to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup.

Planet of Birds Source to all birds on the Planet Folklore Tales New Species Greater Yellow-headed Vulture (Cathartes melambrotus) Cathartidae, Falconiformes, South America [order] FALCONIFORMES | [family] Cathartidae | [latin] Cathartes melambrotus | [authority] Wetmore, 1964 | [UK] Greater Yellow-headed Vulture | [FR] Grand Urubu | [DE] Grosser Gelbkopfgeier | [ES] Aura Selvatica | [NL] Grote Geelkopgier Monotypic species The genus Cathartes includes medium-sized to large carrion-feeding birds in the New World vulture (Cathartidae) family. The three species currently classified in this genus occur widely in the Americas. Physical charateristics The adult is a very deep black overall, with green and purple sheen. Its eyes are red, its feet black and its beak id flesh coloured. The throat and the sides of the head vary from deep yellow to pale orange, with a blue crown and a blue spot in front of the eyes. wingspan min.: 165 cm wingspan max.: 178 cm size min.: 74 cm size max.: 81 cm incubation min.: 32 days incubation max.: 40 days fledging min.: 70 days fledging max.: 85 days broods: 1 eggs min.: 1 eggs max.: 3 South America : Amazonia Typically low tropical forest and less inclined to use open or disturbed forest. The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture roosts on high, exposed dead trees to observe surrounding terrain. When flying, it travels in pairs or alone and is rarely found in groups. Flight is heavy and steady. It flies with its wings held flat or very slightly above horizontal, in what is called the dihedral position. The flight of the Greater Yellow-Headed is an example of static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings. The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture also has the unusual habit of urohydrosis, in which it urinates or defecates on its legs to cool them evaporatively. This behavior is exhibited by storks and New World vultures. Greater Yellow-headed Vultures do not build nests, but rather lay their eggs directly on cliffs, the floors of caves, the ground, or in the hollows of stumps. Eggs are cream-colored and blotched with brown spots, particularly around the larger end. Clutch size ranges from one to three, though two is the norm. The chicks are altricial?blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching, and grow down feathers later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two to three months; eggs are incuated for about five to seven weeks. Feeding habits The primary staple of this vulture's diet is carrion, though it is very fond of fish, and may occasionally take them alive. Relies heavily on olfactoin (smell) to detect prey. The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture is a scavenger and subsists entirely on carrion. It will eat roadkill or other animal carcasses. It prefers fresh meat, but often cannot make the first cut into the carcass of a larger animal as its beak is not strong enough to tear into the tough hide. After a few days, the Greater Yellow-headed Vulture will no longer feed on a piece of carrion, as the meat will begin to decay and become contaminated with microbial toxins. It will drink water from a pool, pond, or any receptacle provided. Like other vultures, they play an important role in the ecosystem by disposing off carrion which could otherwise be a breeding ground for disease. The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture forages using its keen eyesight to locate carrion on the ground, but also uses its sense of smell, an ability which is uncommon in the avian world. It locates carrion by detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. The olfactory lobe of its brain responsible for processing smells is particularly large compared to other animals. This characteristic of New World Vultures has been used by humans: ethyl mercaptan is injected into pipelines, and engineers looking for leaks then follow the vultures. King Vultures, which lack the ability to smell carrion, follow the Greater Yellow-headed Vultures to carcasses, where the King Vulture tears open the skin of the dead animal. This allows the smaller Greater Yellow-headed Vulture access to food, as it does not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both Turkey Vultures and King Vultures, due to their larger size. Video Greater Yellow-headed Vulture httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTrjd1H-Zao copyright: J. del Hoyo This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence <20,000 km2 combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (>30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (<10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be >10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern. The Greater Yellow-Headed Vulture inhabits savannas, Grasslands, and Marshes in South America. It ranges from Argentina and Urugay, as far north as Mexico. In Surinam widely spread in the interior, much less common in the coastal planes. Identification of species uncertain due to overlapping range with Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture.

Connection Issuse after finished print & PC wake-up from sleep. As I am getting into bigger & longer prints I am starting to now notice a issue with connecting to Repetier after I wake-up my PC from its sleep. this is only after a print has finished. The printer will run and finish the print and if I wake it up while it is still printing my connection is fine. It is only after a print has finished when I come back and wake it up that I have this connection issue. What happens is that I notice in the Log is has a message like this below. "Communication Timeout Reset Send Buffer Block" "The connection failed with the following error: Incorrect function. Make sure your printer is connected, enabled and connection data is set correct. Open printer settings?" I looked at the Connection Settings go through them and they look fine, tired switching them and it doesn't help. I tried restarting Repetier and it doesn't help. I even try unplugging the USB for the printer and reconnecting it as well as powering it off for a bit and it doesn't help. Only thing that seems to work so far is restarting the PC. Has any of you run into this before? If so did you ever figure out what may be the issue? Well I figured out what my problem was. It was the set of USB ports I was using. I have a bunch of USB 3.0 ports on the case that connect to my mobo and it seems they are having a bit of a issue for the printer. Once I swapped it with one things connected to a USB 2.0 in the back directly connected to the mobo the printer started working better. Not sure if it is a usb 3.0 or 2.0 thing or just the usb ports on the I/O panel but I am leaning toward the I/O panel as one of my error messages said something about I/O Connection so...... I'll test one of my 3.0 ports in the back that is directly on the mobo to find out 3.0 vs 2.0 thing, but for now I know that my 2.0 port in the back works a lot better. Anyways... For anyone that may run into a similar issue like this, just check your ports. I hope this helps you.

New York, NY: On March 18, music artist L Joevon featuring vocalist Jon Black published a visual to the new single "Candy Red" on iTunes, Spotify, and Tidal with a solid promotional event curated by FYID NYC INC. at the 40/40 club. "Candy Red" is the first part of a series of videos that is the musical storyline to the L Joevon's Seed in the Concrete book. Many guests showed their support at the 40/40 club event including host, Love & Hip Hop celebrity Brittany Taylor and many local artists. The event has increased L Joevon's local fan base and brought awareness to his street outreach programs, teaching the youth to change their perception in order to change their realities. Reflecting on the turnout, L Joevon stated "Being an entrepreneur has its ups and downs, but I remain focused on my persevering message. I was pleased to see FYID [NYC] grow my brand [SITC] into a staple of New York's culture." A part of the "culture" indeed, there was representation from a composite of various burroughs reflecting the diversity of New York. Artists, bloggers, designers all showed support as they watched the new visuals in tandem with SITC documentary making the night a hit in Jay-Z's iconic venue. SITC (Seeds In The Concrete ) is a Brooklyn based company founded by L Joevon to promote his cause enriching the inner city youth by encouraging entrepreneurship, writing, and leadership within the community. From teaching the fundamentals of storytelling to demonstrating the value of being a self-starter in stifling environments, this published author delivers his story amongst the obstacles that plague many contemporaries. This masked hero is often misunderstood due to his passion for his art, but is well received in communities that have shared the warmth of sharing light to grow seeds within the urban concrete. These seeds have flourished even into the music scene with plans for more artistic mediums. "Candy Red" directed by Complex Magazine's Mario de Armas paints a crimson picture of the struggle to maintain love and individuality. With welcoming R&B vocals of Jon Black and L Joevon personality, the cinematic visuals portrayed the story of Lance & Ayana as part of the first of a series of music videos to accompany the novel.. L Joevon intends to branch into more film and music direction to reach an even wider audience for his cause. Please check out the single and music video, now available online.

Dungeons & Dragons Online Forums > Focused Discussions & Feedback > Races > Fighter Armoured Agility?? View Full Version : Fighter Armoured Agility?? I did have one question for all Warforged out there..Does Mithral Fluidity stack with Fighter Armoured Agility? because I was thinking of taking a level of fighter for the feat + enhancements so I could get the armour check penalty of mithral body (which is -2 to skills) to zero with the Mithral Fluidity (+1 to skill penalty) and Fighter Armoured Agility (+1 skill penalty) ?? Doesn't armored agility add to your max dex bonus and fluidity reduce penalty? Not sure about warforged but I thought they were two different things. no,m armor MASTERY affects dex bonus, Agility works like he described. I see no reason why it shouldnt. Feats and enhancements are supposed to stack.
Posted in: No Huddle by Brent Lorentson on September 5th, 2013 There are so many vampire films, it's hard to get excited any time a trailer for one comes along. The Twilight series as well as shows like True Blood and The Vampire Diaries have managed to take everything I once enjoyed about the menacing creature and turned it into a joke. Let the Right One In and the American remake Let Me In are the last vampire films that had any substance that went for more than cheap thrills and gore and delivered a solid story. That is until Kiss of the Damned came along. It's a film that keeps things simple, yet brings back the beautiful elegance of the creature we loved to fear. When we first meet Djuna (Josephine de La Baume), she is locked away in her large beautiful home watching an old B&W romance. She's lonely and craves affection, but her affliction of being a vampire doesn't offer many opportunities to meet the dashing male she is looking for. But as her luck would have it, a trip to the video store has Djuna coming face to face with her true love Paolo (Milo Ventimigilia), a screenwriter who has come to town to get away and work on his current project. The two are instantly attracted to one another, but Djuna does all she can to keep Paolo at a distance, afraid of what he may think of her and the harm she may cause. But he's persistent, and in the heat of passion she takes a bite and changes him. No time is wasted with the film; every scene moves the story along, and though it sticks with the traditional views of vampires, Djuna is among a community of other vampires, all of whom are wealthy and powerful but have chosen to not feed on humans but instead on animals and synthetic bloods. As Djuna guides Paolo into the new lifestyle and everything seems to be going well for the two bloodsuckers, Mimi (Roxane Mesquida) comes along. Mimi is not as refined as Djuna despite them being sisters; Mimi relishes the creature she is and doesn't hold back her sexual inhibitions or her hunger for human blood. As Mimi settles into Djuna's home as she awaits going to a vampire detox facility in Phoenix, Mimi spends her time wreaking havoc on the lives of Djuna and Paolo. The subtlety of Mimi's influence is what makes this performance great; we know what she's up to, but she never forces the characters into any situation; she instead just points them in the direction of their weakness whether it be as primal as sex or blood. Though the idea of a vampire romance has been done to death, this story manages to remain fresh and even has moments where the vampire lifestyle again feels sexy and inviting. Keeping the vampires grounded in reality, no super speed and no freaking sparkling, allows us to see the humanity that remains in these creatures and that has always been what I felt connected us to them. This embraces the thought of being with your true love, in the prime of your lives and never having to change; it's the fantasy I believe anyone would indulge in if given the chance to make it a reality. Even when Djuna and Paolo cave to their weaknesses, they are able to see beyond the short term pain and appreciate the future that awaits the two of them. Perhaps it's this level of forgiveness that seems so fantasy-like in a time when so many of us who will die will carelessly throw away a relationship with their "true love". Written and directed by Xan Cassavetes, the daughter of director John Cassavetes, as a first time feature this has the execution of a director at their prime, and she's only getting started. The camera movements throughout are simple yet beautifully framed, though I did notice at times there seemed to be some editing issues, most notably at the bar when Djuna and Paolo first talk. As the scene cuts between the two their placement seems to move; aside from this scene being a bit off-putting, the rest of the film exceeds and all can be forgiven. Though I'd have a hard time putting this film anywhere near the caliber of Let the Right One In, which in my humble opinion I believe to be a masterpiece. Kiss of the Damned is a small film that delivers a bloody and elegant slap to remind us what vampires once were and should be. The horror isn't in how ferocious they are or how hideous they may be; the horror is their ability to seduce us from the life we have and take us to a place darker than we realize.

Caro Ryan is 'the unexpected outdoors chick' – from a non-outdoorsy family, it took her until she was 21 to discover the world beyond the city, and she's never looked back. Now, she runs well-known Australian outdoors site LotsaFreshAir where she offers tips, advice and reviews to help others discover their own passion for the outdoors. Caro's been a friend of Macpac for a long time, and became an official Ambassador in 2013. Her connection with the outdoors started on a three-day corporate training course, deep in the Budawangs National Park. "I never realised that such amazing places existed, let alone that I could be part of them. There was something about the feeling of being completely remote and self-sufficient that made me feel incredibly small and humbled," says Caro. After a few subsequent unsuccessful attempts at figuring out the bush for herself, Caro joined the Sydney Bush Walkers Club in 2000, and it changed her life. Now, whenever there is a spare moment, she's planning her next adventure – whether that's bushwalking (on track or off) or exploring somewhere that she's never been before. Although her heart is always in the bush, Caro's working life is very busy. She's a passionate producer/director, and spends her working days running a production company that specialises in shooting locations that have tricky logistics. This means she spends quite a bit of time working overseas (or even over-sea), with helicopters or dealing with multiple stakeholders. Caro started outdoor knowledge and tips website Lotsafreshair.com in 2012 with the aim of helping others to discover their own calling to the wilderness. She's created a dedicated and accessible space where she could put together all of the practical information she'd learnt over the years from spending time in the bush. She hopes LotsaFreshAir can inspire others to push past barriers preventing them from getting outdoors, and inspire them to take more adventures. When Caro set up her website, she noticed a lack of available information on the web – and certainly very few stories from a supportive, female or Australian voice. She felt that by sharing what she knows in her trademark low-key and relatable style, people would see that spending time in the outdoors, being active and having moments of adventure isn't hard at all – in fact, it's actually highly enjoyable and rewarding. Being an experienced outdoorsperson, Caro knows how important it is to have the right gear. She's been using Macpac gear for over a decade, and in 2013 became an official brand ambassador. Macpac is proud to have Caro on the team, and to support her in her bushwalking, travels and LotsaFreshAir website. She's got an incredible wealth of knowledge, and inspires many every day to get outdoors and away from the city to experience something new.

In other ways also he has shown great generosity towards those who are less fortunately placed than himself. By birth he is a Mon, and a native of Kawnhat, near Kadoe. At an early miles from his home, at Kadoe, he has started a rubber estate, in which thirty thousand trees have already been planted. He has also conducted extensive experiments in fruit and vegetable growing, and he has now a large fruit garden at Kadoe.

MR. LEONG CHYE is one of the most prominent members of the Chinese community in Moulmein. He is widely known for his contributions to charities, and in 1899 age he commenced to deal in timber, and acquired his present position by dint of hard work, energy, and unflagging perseverance. He is now the owner of large saw-mills and rice mills, of a large number of cargo boats, of paddy land, and of houses and other property. In 1906 his relative, Mr. U.

Stardrifter is a novel by Dale Aycock published in 1981. Plot summary Stardrifter is a novel in which the owner of an interstellar trading company gets caught up in a conspiracy that is looking to rule the galaxy. Reception Greg Costikyan reviewed Star Drifter in Ares Magazine #10 and commented that "The importance is not the plot, which is typical space opera, but Aycock's ability to flesh out characters despite slam-bang action and to turn a pretty phrase or two. Star Drifter is fun reading." The book also received reviews from Voice of Youth Advocates and Gene DeWeese of Science Fiction Review.

For my own personal decorating style, I've found it difficult to incorporate American Flags into my home decor, mostly due to my aversion to country decor (no offense to those who are into it, it's just not my style). So when i went on a hunt to highlight those that were incorporating a patriotic flair to their homes without making it look "country" or even political (yikes), I knew I'd have my work cut out for me. However, I do love the look of a vintage American flag. Much like my obsession with old maps, I could horde old flags until my bank account was at $0, and then I'd still find a way to get another one. So you see, it's a bit of a conundrum for me: How do I use the American flag in my home decor without going country craft? Ummm….the most GORGEOUS Patriotic Wreath ever. What do you think, are any of these speaking to you? I'm so in love with the centerpiece and even the white living room! Happy 4th of July, everyone! Hope you have a wonderful day!
Fire Company Seeks Donations for Headstone, Dedicated Young Volunteer Killed Jogging Off-Duty by First Arriving Dec 28, 2013, 9:36 pm 13 Comments By Hannah Sawyer, York Daily Record, Pa. North Hopewell-Winterstown Photo via Facebook Dec 28 — North Hopewell-Winterstown Fire Company is seeking donations for a headstone for Cory Haley, a firefighter who was struck and killed by a vehicle while he was jogging on Christmas Eve. The department posted on its Facebook page that donations can be mailed to the station: NHWVFC, mark on the donation "For Cory Haley", 12246 Winterstown Road, Felton, PA 17322. Donations also can be dropped off. "This family has suffered and lost an amazing young man! Please help us help the family with this headstone," the department posted on its Facebook page. Thursday update A visitation will be held from 7 to 9 p.m. Sunday at the Winterstown United Methodist Church, 12184 Winterstown Road, according to Cory Haley's obituary. A funeral service will be Monday at 11 a.m. at the church. The obituary talks of Haley's work with Tate Floors in Red Lion and many certifications through his firefighting. He also received a firefighter of the year award in 2012 from the state House of Representatives. The family asks that any memorial contributions be made to the Winterstown Fire Company, 12246 Winterstown Road, Felton. Dec. 26 — A dedicated 24-year-old volunteer firefighter who was engaged and planned to marry in the next few months died Christmas Eve when he was struck by a vehicle while jogging, his chief said. Cory Haley was in training and planned to enlist in the U.S. Air Force later this year in the pararescue unit, North Hopewell-Winterstown Chief Shanan Poe said. Haley, who ran 10-mile routes and swam laps at a local pool two times a week, wouldn't have skipped a workout, even on Christmas Eve, Poe added. That's just what Haley was doing Tuesday evening around 5:30 p.m., when police said he was struck in the southbound lane of Winterstown Road in the Red Lion area. Wearing a reflective band and headphones, Haley was hit by a car driven by 21-year-old Briar Sullivan of Red Lion, according to York Area Regional Police. Haley hit the driver side front and windshield, police said, and was thrown into the northbound lane into the path of a pickup driven by John Warner, 65, of Winterstown. Haley was then run over by the pickup, police said. He was transported to York Hospital where he later died in the operating room at 8:54 p.m., Deputy Coroner Claude Stabley said. The cause of death was multiple blunt force trauma, Stabley said. There will be no autopsy. The North Hopewell-Winterstown Volunteer Fire Co.'s Facebook page quickly filled with comments on Christmas morning from those who knew him. "He was very dedicated with what he does," Poe said. The crash happened just in front of the home of another department volunteers, who ran outside to direct traffic at the scene. It wasn't until paramedics arrived and turned Haley over that the firefighter realized who it was, Poe said. His department has taken the loss to heart, he said. "It's a brotherhood and a sisterhood," Poe said. Poe described him as someone who was always willing to help. He took extra classes at the York County Fire School and always volunteered to help. He would text Poe every day and asked if there was anything he could do at the station. "It's hard on our members to lose someone so young who had so much potential," he said. What he'll remember about Haley is that he had "the biggest heart," he said. Plans for a memorial have not yet been finalized, Poe said. (c)2013 York Daily Record (York, Pa.)

Jarvis St. water main replacement moves at a trickle By Jack LakeyThe Fixer Fri., Jan. 25, 2019timer2 min. read Traffic-snarling construction for at least six months on Jarvis St. long ago began to test the patience of local residents and drivers. So it's no wonder we've gotten a couple notes from frustrated people who live or drive on Jarvis, asking when the misery will finally end. Winnie Jorgensen emailed to say she has endured traffic backups since June to accommodate construction, but the last straw was when they started shutting off water service to her home. In a Jan. 3 note, she said "we at 192 Jarvis were informed the water would be off all day yesterday. It was off from 8 a.m. to about 7 p.m., when it should have been back on at 4 p.m. "The water went back off early this morning," she said, adding, "the street has been a mess since this project started. Lanes have been restricted and deep large holes left open for weeks with water constantly running down Jarvis. "My concern is the time this is taking and the seemingly unbelievable mess that is left behind on a daily basis. There seems to be no attempt to keep the work areas tidy. "It looks like a fiasco, a very messy one." We went there and saw that two lanes of northbound traffic were squeezed into one, from south of Queen St. to just north of Dundas St., where condo construction is occupying the curb lane. Southbound traffic is also narrowed to one lane between Dundas and Queen, which slows it to a crawl on a key route used by drivers to get in and out of the downtown core during rush hour. We watched last week as a line of vehicles inched northward through the lane reduction at the start of the afternoon rush; it took upwards of 10 minutes for drivers to get from Queen to north of Dundas. Status: Susan Pape, a spokesperson for the city, emailed to confirm that the lane reductions are necessary to replace "two vintage water mains, both over 100 years old, with a new, larger diameter water main," to improve local service. The work was delayed, "however it is near completion and all lanes are scheduled to reopen by the end of January. There are no other temporary water shut-offs planned (or) associated with this work." She went on to say delays in completing the project were caused by a change in plans that allowed the city to install new water mains closer to private properties, which will improve service, and also for rigorous testing of water quality, required by the provincial environment ministry. A condo project at Dundas and Jarvis that is occupying the curb lane is scheduled for completion by the end of June, said Pape. What's broken in your neighbourhood?

I graduated from Thunderbird High in 1983 in a royal blue gown, which I wore over the same royal blue sundress and with strappy white flats, so I wouldn't sink into the football field. No fewer than 127 bobby pins held my cap snug. The principal and administrators filled their folding chairs on the stage as we lined up, boys on one side, girls on the other, and swore we'd never forget – not how Mr. Prochnau gave us extra credit in biology if we wore a shoelace necklace of dissected pig parts, or drinking Boone's Farm Tickle Pink on the golf course at the Moon Valley Country Club, nor one another. Not ever. The speeches that night were endless, reaching me near the front because my last name started with a B first and echoing back to the Z's. These had been the best years of our lives. We were the future. We were the best and the brightest. We could do anything. We had an obligation to change the world. All we had to do was be true to ourselves, follow our dreams and reach for the stars. I believed every word. I've been to a lot of high school graduations since my own. I go to a few more every year, it seems. Not much has changed. They're still wearing the same outfits and playing much of the same music with the same pomp and circumstance. The same people line the stage on folding chairs – the principal and other administrators, the school board and distinguished guests. Even the speeches have stayed pretty much the same, with minor variations on the theme. In speech after speech, we're reminded how the last four years have just flown by, how they started as freshman who got lost in the hallways, it feels like just yesterday, and look at where they are now. Insert here the requisite funny prank pulled on (easy-going teacher's name), hilarious incident at (annual talent show/fall festival/pep rally) and inside joke from three-day school trip to (name of place within six-hour bus ride here). Best years of their lives. Friends forever. But this isn't an ending, oh, no, it's only the beginning. They are the future. It was a journey of a thousand miles that began with a single step, and whenever one door closed, another opened, but now the path ahead was clear. They have only to be true to themselves, follow their dreams, reach for the stars. And if you don't want to take the speakers' word for it, they quote an (adult) expert. Henry David Thoreau. Les Brown. Ralph Waldo Emerson. Walt Disney. Dr. Seuss. I sit in the bleachers, listening, and smile wryly. I tick off the clichés: You are the future. Don't be afraid to fail. Make a difference. This year, the valedictorian who spoke at McClintock High, Trinny Tat, was refreshingly real. First of all, she promised to keep it short. "I don't want you all to fall asleep," she said. Trinny did speak of surviving standardized testing and supplementing suspect lunches with cookies sold by DECA, Rice KrispiesTreats from swim team and dance club fundraisers and candy bars from orchestra. "I know we are anxious about our future, but keep it real," she said. "I am gonna be a freeloader as long as I can. And you can too as long as your parents don't throw you out in the street." Parents in the stands chuckled. Trinny quoted Will Rogers: "Even if you are on the right track, you will get run over if you just sit there." Trinny is from Vietnam and started school here seven years ago in English Language Learner classes. She told her classmates, "Without putting effort, one will just sit at one place and not going anywhere even if the path is right. At the same time, other people are taking that chance, that direction to get to the place you were going to. "The world is a judgmental place. The world is a scary place. The world is not fair, but deal with it because other people are experiencing the same thing." Don't just dream about it, she was telling them. Do the work. She was on to something. Listening to her made me think about just what I would tell a football stadium full of high school graduates, if given the chance. You can be anything you want to be, but you have to do the work and pay your dues. These might feel like the best years of your life — so far — especially since you were just coming out of the agony of middle school. Trust me, there are even better years ahead. If you hated high school, for whatever reason, there's a good chance you will love college. It's bigger, and more diverse, you'll find people like you. Those may well be the friends you'll keep forever. Listen to what the commencement speakers are saying because when you're young, these things are all true, and no one wants to tell you any different. That's why everyone is smiling at you, like you're a toddler taking your first steps. Because basically, you are. While you're reaching for those stars, you're going to make some mistakes. Some of them will feel like they're fatal mistakes. They're not. Know that there are few things that can't be fixed. Ask for help. Find a mentor. Thank your teachers. Learn about technology. Or, whatever you study, put the word "forensic" in front of it – forensic psychology, forensic accounting. It's not really true what they say (I say "they" because no one knows who for sure), that if you do what you love, you'll never work another day in your life. Because even if you love it, it's still work. It'll get you down sometimes. That's OK. Pay attention to your parents. Call them regularly. They did a lot for you. Pay attention to the local news. Vote. Read. Drive safely. Give to charity. (Donating blood doesn't cost anything.) Make sure everybody gets a fair chance. (Oh, you think there's no more gender barrier? Then why are half of you still wearing different colored robes and sitting on opposite sides of the aisle?) Take care of yourself. I don't mean manicures and pedicures or gym memberships. I mean, go outside. Look up from your screen occasionally. Drink plenty of water. Eat vegetables. Get enough sleep. Moderate your drinking. Don't smoke. Do wear sunscreen. And just do your best. Try not to compare yourself to others. Stretch yourself. Know it's OK to be scared. In fact you should be scared sometimes. It's not as easy as living your dreams and being yourself. But it's also not as hard as being the entire future, carrying the responsibility to change the whole world. Just don't give up. You'll be fine.

Iconic observatory witnessed in James Bond film "GoldenEye" goes darkish soon after enormous telescope located mysteriously damaged A significant radio telescope designed famed as the backdrop for a pivotal scene in James Bond film "GoldenEye" and other Hollywood hits was located out of the blue out of commission just after cables mysteriously snapped and smashed into the facility's principal dish. The Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico is dwelling to one particular of the world's premier radio telescopes, performing as a giant ear to the universe. Positioned in the middle of a forest, the telescope listens for radio indicators from other galaxies and has contributed to various breakthroughs in astronomy. Aside from monitoring asteroids that could endanger the world, the telescope performed a important function in the "SETI" program — the research for smart daily life. It was notably employed by astronomer Carl Sagan to mail an interstellar message. Before this week, the facility was pressured to close down soon after a cable supporting a metal system higher than the telescope fell, tearing a 100-foot gash in its giant reflector dish. "The cable didn't definitely crack in the sense of a cable kind of snapping, but it just kind of slipped from its socket, which is you know, an even weirder situation," Arecibo Observatory Director Francisco Cordova instructed CBS News' Jeff Glor. Specialists operating all over the clock to get the telescope back again on line say they are nevertheless building assessments to locate what precisely took place, storing the machine's "structure of capabilities," and earning confident it could not direct to much more troubles in the upcoming. "So at this place, we are not, you know, we don't seriously have a even larger timeline of when that is going to materialize," Cordova stated. See also The robot dog urges beer and moves according to the environment; View | Technology The telescope, a pivotal element of the ongoing search to locate other planets able of sustaining everyday living, has survived terrestrial hazards like hurricanes, tropical storms and earthquakes. Now, the scientific group hopes it can get better from the mysterious injury. "We are going to discover a way to fix this particular concern and continue to transfer forward," Cordova mentioned. "We have overcome a whole lot in our 50-year historical past, from Hurricane Maria to extremely the latest rash of earthquakes to now this. So we're a very resilient bunch down listed here and we are going to determine out a way to continue on to move forward, accomplishing thrilling science for the world."
Origin Part V Some things are better left undiscovered! Charlie silently followed her as she stepped across the threshold, and as she did a faint blue glow illuminated the center of the room. She stopped and stepped back, suddenly unsure if she should continue, and the blue light faded to darkness. Stepping forward again, she was rewarded with the return of that blue glow that seemed to emanate from the center of the room. Following the beam of her flashlight, they both ventured deeper into the chamber, coming to a stone bench on their right. She played the beam of the flashlight over the dust-covered surface of the bench, noting how it curved to the left as it vanished into the shadows. There was another bench thee feet in front of the first, it too curving into the emptiness that pressed in on all sides. With growing confidence she pushed on, coming to a third bench in front of the second one. As they ventured deeper into the chamber, she slowly became aware that the blue glow was coming from an object to her immediate front. She stopped, took a deep breath, and switched off her flashlight. "Turn off your light," she said. Charlie complied and as her eyes adjusted to the darkness the blue glow grew stronger until she could make out the shape of a large blue globe hanging suspended an unknown distance before her. More details came into focus and she began picking out tiny spots of light high above her head all around her. The image reminded her of a planetarium during a showing and she suddenly realized that what she was gazing upon was the home world of whatever had built this structure. "See what?" "Close your eyes for a minute and let them adjust to the dark." Sandra closed her own eyes and when she reopened them that alien solar system was once again laid out before her with that faint blue sun in the center. "What the hell," Charlie said. "I think that's why they came here." "Those who built this structure. Their sun was dying." "A star system, their home." "Of course, who did you think I was talking about?" "How can you be so sure?" "I'm not absolutely certain. Not one hundred percent. But the explanation fits." "Then where are they now?" Sandra shrugged. "I don't know." They had moved forward to a raised dais a foot higher than the rest of the floor. Stepping up together, they approached the blue sphere, beneath which rested a small white box. Charlie reached the item first, marveling at the craftsmanship that had gone into constructing this small object. It looked like fine marble cut into very thin sheets, somewhat transparent, its contents were a faint smudge against the white. "What is it?" Charlie said. "I don't know." Sandra touched the surface of the box and when she did her mind was suddenly filled with ancient images of an alien place that was all but a memory. She saw a vast valley beneath a blue sun. From the floor of the valley rose an immense tower. The spires of Beizel in the valley of tears. The name came to her from the black depths of a consciousness that stretched into the antediluvian void of their past. She could feel them around her, the followers who had trekked to this desolate plain, and the faithful who had come to seek redemption. Their thoughts washed over and around her, a single voice in a seething populace whose movements were so perfectly timed they took on the appearance of the surface of the ocean as gentle swells raced from one end to the other in a continuous cycle. They had come seeking salvation and found it in the singularity of one thought that washed through them with a solitary voice. The individual parts of the whole had come together to form a distinct thought, and that was survival of the species. Their sun was dying, the time for the planet, for their reign, had come to a close. But one chance remained, the survival of the species lay with the chosen who would reach out into the great beyond; to ensure the survival of the species they would venture into the farthest reaches of the cosmos in their search for a new planet to call their own. Sandra stepped back from the box, her fingers numbed by the contact, struggling to catch her breath as the true meaning of what she had briefly seen began to sink in. They did not belong here. In the shadows around her their memories moved with a sinuous ease through the deeper night. "Are you all right?" Charlie said, resting his hand on her shoulder as he stepped forward to look at the box resting on the raised dais. "Don't touch it," she warned him. But he ignored her, reaching out to grasp the box in one hand as he softly whispered, "So beautiful." Before she could stop him, he had flipped open the delicate hasp and was raising the lid to gaze upon what the box contained. Sandra became aware of movement in the shadows all around her as that ozone aroma intensified. Her hair felt like it was standing on end in response to the suddenly charged atmosphere. Tentacles of darkness slithered across the dais towards them. Check out Adversary, book one of the Shadows of the Past series. Click on cover for more info or to order!

The event, which took place at the Begin-Sadat Center, involved the participation of experts from Greece, Russia, Britain, Turkey, Albania, the US, and Israel. Shortly after the US presidential election in November, experts met the BESA Center to analyze the reasons for, and international implications of, Donald Trump's triumph, and to dissect the "Yom Kippur" of the liberal elite and media. In June, experts from Belgium, Bahrain, France, Germany, India, the UK, US and Israel convened at the BESA Center and at Haifa's National Security Studies Center for a two-day international conference to study developments in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf.

Q: If $\sum_{n=1}^\infty E(X_n-X_{n-1})^2/b_n^2 < \infty$, then $X_n/b_n \rightarrow 0$ a.s. This is Durrett Exercise 5.4.9. I'm trying to show that if $X_n$ is a martingale, and $b_m \uparrow \infty$, $\sum_{n=1}^\infty E(X_n-X_{n-1})^2/b_n^2 < \infty$, then $X_n/b_n \rightarrow 0$ a.s.. If $X_n \in L^2$, I can show that this reduces to Durrett Exercise 5.4.8, which I have solved, since the above also gives us that the the sum of $\sum_{n=1}^\infty E\left(\frac{X_n}{b_n}-\frac{X_{n-1}}{b_{n-1}}\right)^2<\infty$, and then I can use orthogonality of martingale increments, and $L^p$ convergence theorem to conclude that it converges in almost surely and in $L^2$, although I'm not sure that I can show it converges to 0. But, in this case, I am stuck and unable to proceed A: Hints: Since $b_n \uparrow \infty$ we may assume without loss of generality that $b_n>1$ for all $n \geq 1$. Let's first assume additionally that $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is square integrable and $X_0 = 0$. * *Set $$Y_n := \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{X_i-X_{i-1}}{b_i}.$$ Show that $(Y_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a squre-integrable martingale with $$\mathbb{E}(Y_n^2) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\mathbb{E}((X_i-X_{i-1})^2)}{b_i^2}.$$ *It follows from Step 1 and the assumptions on $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ that $(Y_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is an $L^2$-bounded martingale. The martingale convergence thorem yields that $Y_n$ converges almost surely, i.e. $$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{X_i-X_{i-1}}{b_i}$$ converges with probability $1$. *Apply Kronecker's lemma to deduce that $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{X_n}{b_n} = 0 \quad \text{a.s.}$$ For the general case: Define $\tilde{X}_n := X_n-X_0$. * *Check that $\sum_n \mathbb{E}((X_n-X_{n-1})^2)/b_n^2 < \infty$ implies $\sum_n \mathbb{E}((\tilde{X}_n-\tilde{X}_{n-1})^2)/b_n^2 < \infty$. *Deduce from $\mathbb{E}((\tilde{X}_n-\tilde{X}_{n-1})^2)< \infty$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and $\tilde{X}_0 =0 \in L^2(\mathbb{P})$ that $\tilde{X}_n \in L^2(\mathbb{P})$ for all $n \geq 1$. *Apply the first part of this answer to $\tilde{X}_n$.

British R&B/Soul songstress Cherri V began the year with her exciting new single 'Swimming' featuring Birmingham rapper RoxXxan, which has been garnering strong early support from BBC 1Xtra, The Beat London, Reprezent Radio, ILUVLIVE and SingersRoom, among others. Now, she he returns with the accompanying visuals for 'Swimming', premiered exclusively via 1883 Magazine. Produced by Asylum 33, who have previously worked with Tinie Tempah, Mr. Eazi, Shakka, and Bonkaz, among others, the music video for 'Swimming' sees Cherri V and RoxXxan bringing a more relaxed and organic visual element to the experimental R&B offering, as they party among friends, while Cherri V gets to know her leading man, without the usual pressures that come with meeting someone new. Speaking especially about those pressures, and how her 'Swimming' music video speaks directly to those real life situations we all face when looking for love, Cherri V explains, "There's nothing like meeting a guy through friends, ones who can vouch for him and give you that casual introduction. No pressure, just friends amongst friends, getting familiar in a relaxed setting". Expanding on the inspiration for her 'Swimming' visuals, Cherri V adds, "I'm glad Asylum 33 (who produced the video) were able to capture that house party relaxed feel. I also wanted to take a little more of a casual approach for this video, compared to 'Leave Me Be', and shove my real friends in front of the camera lol. The shots in the pool were a highlight for me! I'm really proud of this visual". Check out the video in our box above.
Q: ODBC and DB2 stored procedures from C#: Routine not found I seem have come across a short coming with ODBC and DB2 when running stored procedures. It seems that it is not possible to return data from a stored procedure, and I have a prexisting query that I need to use. Has anyone got around this particular issue? Thanks in advance Update The code that I am calling is as follows (assuming that the connection is already opened): string BaseSQL = "CALL B6009822.O#04666803.PUT"; OdbcCommand command = new OdbcCommand(BaseSQL, myConnection); command.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure; command.Parameters.Add("@Owner", OdbcType.VarChar).Value = "MH"; int rows = command.ExecuteNonQuery(); myConnection.Close(); I get the following error .. ERROR [HY000] [IBM][System i Access ODBC Driver][DB2 for i5/OS]SQL0440 - Routine PUT in O#04666803 not found with specified parameters. It seems to be objecting to the catalog/library and procedure name. Any idea on what I need to do to get the procedure called ? Second Update - real example string BaseSQL = "{ CALL B6009822.O#04666803.PUT(?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?) }"; OdbcCommand command = myConnection.CreateCommand(); command.CommandText = BaseSQL; //OdbcCommand command = new OdbcCommand(BaseSQL, myConnection); command.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure; /* @Param1 VarChar(4), @Param2 dec(8,0), @Param3 dec(4,0), @Param4 dec(8,0), @Param5 VarChar(60), @Param6 dec(9,2), @Param7 dec(9,0), @Param8 dec(9,2), @Param9 VarChar(10)) */ command.Parameters.Add("@Param1", OdbcType.VarChar, 4).Value = "MH"; command.Parameters.Add("@Param2", OdbcType.Decimal, 8).Value = 20110217; command.Parameters.Add("@Param3", OdbcType.Decimal, 4).Value = 1; command.Parameters.Add("@Param4", OdbcType.Decimal, 8).Value = 178377; command.Parameters.Add("@Param5", OdbcType.VarChar, 60).Value = "Description"; command.Parameters.Add("@Param6", OdbcType.Decimal, 9).Value = 0; command.Parameters.Add("@Param7", OdbcType.Decimal, 9).Value = 45; command.Parameters.Add("@Param8", OdbcType.Decimal, 9).Value = 0; command.Parameters.Add("@Param9", OdbcType.VarChar, 10).Value = "*CREATE"; int rows = command.ExecuteNonQuery(); myConnection.Close(); A: Have you tried the CALL syntax? http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dzichelp/v2r2/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db29.doc.odbc/db2z_odbcspcall.htm EDIT: Just in case my comment above is correct: From this resource, have you tried: string BaseSQL = "CALL B6009822.O#04666803.PUT (?)"; Important: Unlike ODBC, DB2 ODBC does not support literals as procedure arguments. You must use parameter markers to specify a procedure parameter. A: First of all I had to make the library (or whatever the proper term is) visible in the "System i Navigator". It seems that there is an issue with stored procedures that return results, so I had to call it as a SELECT, as shown below ... "SELECT PUT('{4}',{1},1,{0},'{2}',0,{3},0,'{5}') as A from LIBRARY.EARNER where EAR = '{4}'" Not sure if this helps anyone else other than me though! A: For any DB2 n00bs like myself hitting this page searching for answers to "SQL0440 - Routine [YourRoutine] in [*N | LIBRARY] not found with specified parameters"... For me, my problem was where I had defined the constant for the stored procedure name, like so: // Database Constants public const string DB_PROC_GET_MYPROC = @"LIBRARY.MYPROC"; How I should have declared it was: // Database Constants public const string DB_PROC_GET_MYPROC = @"LIBRARY.MYPROC(@stateCode, @productCode, @tranType)"; ...with the parameters included. I've spent so long with Entity Framework, I have all but forgotten direct database connection basics in c#. Hope this saves someone some time.

Censure au Centre Pompidou Julio Le Parc presents a brief explanation about a situation in which he was not permitted to include a pamphlet with his works in the Denise René L'intrépide exhibition. Due to this situation, which he considered to be censorship, Le Parc invited, through this writing, anyone who wanted to accompany him on Friday, April 20, 2001, at 6:30 PM to paste the pamphlet over one of his works. Julio Le Parc (1928) was born in the Province of Mendoza, in Argentina, and graduated in Buenos Aires. In 1955, he participated in the student movement that took over the country's fine arts schools, and in 1958, Le Parc traveled to Paris on a scholarship. While there, between 1960 and 1968, he became part of the GRAV, Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel [Experimental Visual Arts Research Group], which, in turn, participated in the Nouvelle Tendence [New Tendency] international movement. He later continued his visual research and production within the kinetic art movement. On many occasions, his positions on various issues from the point of view of a Latin American artist were accounted for. Since 1945, the Parisian Denise René art gallery has promoted abstraction, especially in its geometric and kinetic aspects. Given that the authorities at the Centre Georges Pompidou did not allow him to include his pamphlet that accompanied the works presented in the Denise René L'intrépide exhibition, which took place there between April 4 and June 4, 2001, Le Parc titled this explanation Censura en el Centre Pompidou [Censorship at the Pompidou Center]. This source has been selected as evidence of the invitation to the symbolic act in which he proceeded to stick the pamphlet on one of his works. This document is linked to the pamphlet dated April 3, 2001. Note that the exhibition was also presented at the Centro Atlántico de Arte Moderno de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria [Grand Canary Island], between September 18 and November 18, 2001, albeit with another title:El arte abstracto y la Galería Denise René [Abstract Art and the Denise René Gallery].

Castel Sant'Angelo – Hadrian's Mausoleum by Thomas Dowson | Italy, Rome | 0 comments Across the St Angelo Bridge from the bulk of the ancient city of Rome and not far from Vatican City, Castel Sant'Angelo dominates the northern bank of the Tiber River. Construction started on an artificial mound in the 120s for the Emperor Hadrian's mausoleum. By the time of his death on 10 July 138 AD, the funerary monument was incomplete. The mausoleum was completed by Antoninus Pius in 139 AD. The ashes of the late emperor and his wife Sabina (who had died before Hadrian), as well as those of Aelius Caesar (Hadrian's first adopted heir) were the first to be interred here. Subsequent emperors, their wives and immediate family also had their ashes deposited here – the last recorded emperor being Caracalla in 217 AD. The information and details on this page were last checked and/or updated on 20 February 2022. Facilities & Visiting Castel Sant'Angelo: Buying Tickets for Castel Sant'Angelo Small Group, Guided Tours of Castel Sant'Angelo What not to miss during your visit: The Mausoleum of Hadrian, now a popular museum in Rome. During the 3rd century AD, the mausoleum was incorporated into the Tiber fortifications. Various architectural features, prominent today were being added up until the 16th century. Consequently much of what visitors see today from the outside is not ancient at all; the ancient structure is preserved within and at the foot of the circular drum. Throughout the period between the 13th and 16th century, the following structures were added as the purpose of the building changed and developed: the upper half of the circular drum, the palace with its statue of archangel Michael, the four bastions on the corners of the podium, the castles curtain wall, and the ditch and outer triangular fortifications. After also being used as a prison, the building was decommissioned in 1901, and has been used as a museum ever since. You can purchase a skip-the-line ticket in advance online from GetYourGuide. With this ticket not only do you get to beat the queues, but you will be met at the entrance by greeter (hosts speak English, French, German, Italian and Spanish) who will take you through the entrance. There is no need to worry about anything. Included in the ticket is the option to cancel your ticket up to 24 hours in advance for a full refund, without paying an extra fee. Three thematic routes guide visitors through the castle: the mausoleum of Hadrian, the fortified castle and the papal apartments. When in the papal apartments do not miss Pope Clement VII's bathroom. Besides the antique style decoration of the room, from here you will get an excellent view of the passetto. Built in 1277 along the top of the ninth century wall, this passage was constructed to provide an escape route running between the Vatican and the Castle. The route of the passetto is marked out with blue pins in the map above, as it runs along Via dei Corridori.

Q: Inserting more than one data field in a sorted data structure What is the best data structure to use when you need to insert more than 1 (like 10) data fields in a node and have the nodes to be stored in the ascending order of their key? A: In general, inserts element need 3 steps: * *locate where to insert *insert it *adjust data structure if needs If the inserting elements have regularity(like all elements equals, It will save 1. locate where to insert time in linked list), but time complexity still O(n). If the inserting elements have no regularity, it random enough. There is no difference between inserting one and insert batch. So in one word, there is no special data structure for batch inserting. but you can improve Constant Time Complexity in some special conditions. PS: common sorted data structure is balanced binary tree, spends O(logn) time complexity when updating

French City Installs 187 Solar Panels to Save on Energy Costs, Forgets to Connect Them Officials in the French city of Roubaix recently revealed that the 187 photovoltaic panels that were supposed to generate green electricity for the local library had been installed six months ago, but not connected to the building's electrical grid… In June of 2019, thew city of Roubaix announced with great fanfare that it had acquired 187 solar panels meant to generate part of the electricity required by the local library. The panels were installed by local company Sunretec at a cost of 103,000 euros ($113,000), but somehow everyone forgot to actually connect them to the library's electrical grid, which means that for six months the panels didn't produce any of the electricity consumed by the Roubaix library. French Coffee House Owner Refuses to Sell His Life's Work – A Story of Courage Although his is the only standing building in what used to be an old neighborhood of Roubaix, in Northern France, Salah Oudjani refuses to sell the coffee house he has worked in for the last 46 years. The title doesn't sound like anything special, after all, many people refuse to have their property demolished, at least in the beginning, until they get a good price or they notice everyone else is selling except them. But for the 71-year-old business owner neither of the above reasons were good enough. The two-story triangular building once located at the intersection of two streets appears to be the only survivor of a serious air raid. Everything around it has been turned to rubble and taken to local landfills, brick by brick, and Oudjani's place looks like it's the only sign of life in a wasteland. Like all the other residents, the café owner has received numerous proposals for his property, but he never even considered selling it. "I will not sell! I worked for it, this coffee house. They will not make me go, I'm used to pressure" Oudjani says, and everyone knows he means it. French Town Inaugurates Bubble Hotel Rooms in Local Park By Spooky onAugust 3rd, 2011 Category: News, Travel The French town of Roubaix, has recently opened a series of portable hotel rooms in a local park. They can be rented by people who want to feel close to nature in the middle of the urban jungle. The bubble concept thought up by French designer Pierre Stephane Dumas aims to redefine the term temporary leisure accommodation, and is based on the following principles: minimum energy, minimum material, maximum comfort and maximum interaction with the environment. The unusual bubble rooms were launched in 2010 and have since then been made available to people who want to enjoy a unique experience in the middle of nature, for around $700 a night. In the French city of Roubaix, a series of bubble hotel rooms have been installed in one of the local parks. They come with a clear view of the sky and offer nature lovers to be close to their environment without having to travel to far away. The bubbles are made of recycled plastic and, once inflated retain their shape thanks to an airlock at the entrance and a silent pump which creates constant pressure. Outside noises are reduced to a minimum while inside noises are maximized, so the visitors are encouraged to whisper to each other, in order to create a peaceful atmosphere.
John Rollo M.D. (d. December 23, 1809) was a Scottish military surgeon, now known for his work on a diabetic diet. Rollo was the first to suggest a low-carbohydrate diet as a treatment for diabetes. Life He was born in Scotland, and received his medical education at Edinburgh. He became a surgeon in the Royal Artillery in 1776, and then served in the West Indies. In 1778 the University of St Andrews made him M.D. He was stationed in St. Lucia in 1778–9 and in Barbados in 1781. His associates included Colin Chisholm on Grenada. Rollo became surgeon-general of the Royal Artillery in 1794, and returned to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. There he oversaw the construction of the enlarged Royal Artillery Hospital: the Royal Ordnance Hospital dated from about 1780, and the enlargement was completed in 1806 (the building later became the Connaught Barracks). From 1804 he was inspector of hospitals for the Ordnance. Rollo was frequently consulted about cases of diabetes, and in treatment had some success with the use of a nitrogenous diet. He died at Woolwich on 23 December 1809, and was buried at Plumstead in Greenwich. Diabetes In 1797 Rollo printed at Deptford Notes of a Diabetic Case, which described the improvement of an officer with diabetes who was placed on a meat diet. He was the first to take Matthew Dobson's discovery of glycosuria in diabetes mellitus and apply it to managing metabolism. By means of Dobson's testing procedure (for glucose in the urine) Rollo worked out a diet that had success for what is now called type 2 diabetes. The addition of the term "mellitus", distinguishing the condition from diabetes insipidus, has been attributed to Rollo. Rollo's diet for diabetic patients consisted of "milk, lime water, bread and butter, blood pudding, meat, and rancid fat". He has been described as "the first one to recommend a diet low in carbohydrates as a treatment for diabetes." Rollo collaborated with William Cruickshank, who was the chemistry assistant at Woolwich. In another edition of the work, An Account of Two Cases of the Diabetes Mellitus, published in 1798, other cases were added, and some of Cruikshank's research on urine and sugar in diabetics was included. A further edition appeared in 1806. John Latham supported Rollo's views on the treatment. In 1824 the Encyclopædia Britannica in its article "Dietetics" commented that the diet was successful in repressing the condition of the patients' urine, but that the patients often found the high fat content intolerable. This kind of dietary management continued to the 1920s, being more successful for adults, who might survive some years, than for young patients who typically had only some months of life on it. Other collaborations of Rollo and Cruikshank related to treatments for syphilis involving acids, and published with the work on diabetes; proteinuria; and strontium. Other work Rollo published Observations on the Diseases in the Army on St. Lucia, in 1781; and in 1785 Remarks on the Disease lately described by Dr. Hendy, on a form of elephantiasis known as "Barbados leg". In 1786 he published Observations on the Acute Dysentery. Rollo published in 1801 a Short Account of the Royal Artillery Hospital at Woolwich. He had kept a record of his cases in Barbados, and the Account included a similar table for the Ordnance hospital. In 1804 a Medical Report on Cases of Inoculation supported the views of Edward Jenner. References Further reading Alexander Marble. (1989. John Rollo. In: von Engelhardt D.

The Chennault Aviation and Military Museum (CAMM) and the Ouachita Parish School System Talented Art Program recently partnered to present the American Spirit Challenge Student Competition. The competition is in conjunction with the annual juried art exhibition that the Talented Art Program holds showcasing student artwork. CAMM Director, Adrienne LaFrance-Wells said, "We are thrilled to have the opportunity to encourage these students to consider the brave sacrifices that were made to preserve the freedoms that they enjoy every day by creating these beautiful works of art. Showcasing the young talent in our area is so important, as is promoting patriotism among our youth." The Northeast Louisiana Arts Council conducted judging so judges could remain objective. Prize awards were sponsored by Homeland Bank, the Selman Field Historical Association and the Fort Miro Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The first prize winner, Alison Lau of Sterlington High School, chose WWII Hump Pilot, J.V. Vinyard, as her portrait subject. Vinyard spoke to around 500 students and parents at the Student Services Center art reception about his time flying over the Himalayan Mountains as the supply line in China during the war. CAMM has an exhibit on Vinyard in the Chennault exhibit room. Han Vu of Ouachita Parish High School won Second prize for a portrait of her father who served in the South Vietnamese Air Force in the Vietnam War. West Ouachita High School student, Christina Ford, won third for her charcoal of WWII veteran, Cornelius Glenn Whitley, CPL US Marine Corps. Woodmen of the World is a sponsor locally for National History Day, providing cash prizes for students. All students were recognized at a reception at the Chennault Museum.
Home / News / MPs hear mum's story of hard-work and education MPs hear mum's story of hard-work and education Inspirational young mum Chevonne Lawson has been telling MPs how she transformed herself - from an 'in care' troubled youth to an adult learner studying for a degree in Criminology. Chevonne and her Sunderland College lecturer of five years Katherine Bone headed for a Parliamentary Reception at the House of Commons as part of National Adult Learners Week. The 22-year-old mum is studying for a degree in Criminology but not that long ago she was in care and pregnant. She was invited to the event in London after winning a national award that recognised her hard work and dedication. Chevonne, from Town End Farm, Sunderland, said: "Attending the reception at the Houses of Parliament was quite an experience and something I couldn't have imagined doing just a few years ago. "I had quite a troubled upbringing and after a violent relationship life wasn't quite going the way I planned. "There was a lot of trouble on the estate where I lived and when I found out I was pregnant I decided I didn't want the same for my daughter Saskia, now four. "I needed a change and enrolled on a Level 1 Connect course at Sunderland College and I've never looked back. "I've worked hard and kept at it and the support and advice I've been given from staff at Sunderland College has been second to none." Chevonne learning while at school was hampered due to dyslexia and dyspraxia but with excellent support from Sunderland College she is now studying for a degree in Criminology at Sunderland University. Now engaged to fiancé Gavin and mum to a son, also called Gavin aged two and step-mum to her fiancées daughter Katie, seven, she wants to put her experiences to good use by setting up her own courses to work with youth offenders and the homeless. Lecturer Katherine said: "Chevonne's story is fantastic and shows what can be achieved with commitment, hard work and the level of support offered at Sunderland College. "Chevonne is one of many adult learners we have at the College who are shaping their futures, and doing it while working, caring for young children, and in some cases both. "We try our very best at Sunderland College to help all our students, whatever their individual circumstances, to be the best that they can be through a programme of quality education, teaching and support." Michelle Elliott, Head of Employer and Employability at Sunderland College, said: "The College has a lot to offer adult learners. "We have a generous support package and can help people with all they need to know about fees and financing. "We aim to make getting higher and adult education qualifications as fuss free as possible." The achievements of all adult learners are being recognised across the College. One learner who is celebrating is Wayne Barber. Wayne was made redundant as a miner from Easington Colliery nearly 20 years ago and has been unemployed ever since. The 53-year-old has now enrolled on a construction course and is enjoying learning new skills that he hopes will land him permanent employment. Wayne said: "Returning to education has shown me that you're never too old to learn something new. "I find learning stimulating and for the first time in a long time I'm feeling positive about getting out and looking for work. "I'm keen to put my new skills to the test."

The first book in the re-launched WITF Pick of the Month is "Beautiful Boy: A Father's Journey Through His Son's Addiction" by David Sheff. This is a deeply honest and moving firsthand account of how a young man's addiction to drugs affects his health, his family, and their community. This selection ties directly into WITF's ongoing "Real Life Real Issues: Drugs and Young People" project. "Beautiful Boy" is an unflinching look at author David Sheff, his son Nic, and their family's battle with Nic's drug addiction. It demonstrates the importance of a family's love in helping a young addict with his struggles, while also showing that no matter how strong the family may be, they can't make the addict change. The book alternates between Sheff's work as an accomplished journalist trying to understand addiction and recovery, and his struggles as a father with the very real possibility that Nic will never get better. Nic Sheff was a charming, funny kid, a varsity athlete, and an honor student, but he hid a growing addiction to drugs, primarily methamphetamines, that nearly killed him. Looking back, the father sees the subtle warning signs, including late night disappearances, evasions, and denials that would lead to deeper troubles. While trying to help Nic, David develops his own addiction - obsession with his son's addiction - which has additional consequences for their family. Nic has also written about his own addiction, first in his autobiography "Tweak: Growing Up on Methamphetamines" and then his follow-up about his relapses and continuing struggles in "We All Fall Down: Living With Addiction."
Webster's Knucklehead keeps it all in the family Will Cleveland @WillCleveland13 On Saturday afternoon, the entire staff at Knucklehead Brewing in Webster consisted of the Dummer family. Father Len, the brewery founder, was working behind the bar with his wife, Kathy. Oldest son, Jacob, one of Knucklehead's brewers, was also pouring drinks. Youngest son, Joshua, a chef with professional experience at places like Wegmans' Next Door Bar and Grill, was running the newly-opened kitchen. The place was packed. Everyone, not hyperbole, was smiling. I was smiling. It was just a happy place to be. In Knucklehead, you feel like you're part of the Webster community, because that's how the Dummer family wants you to feel. "Being able to work with family, and I speak for George also, is the best," said Len Dummer, an affable gentleman, who was sporting a cheeky doctor costume to celebrate Halloween. "My wife is my best friend. So working with her and both of my sons, it's a true blessing. Both of my sons had careers that they quit to come into the family business. It's a true blessing. I can't explain it to people." Dummer notes that working with family can present some challenges, but he wouldn't change a thing. "There are arguments between me and my sons," Dummer said. "My youngest son and I had a behind-the-scenes argument yesterday, but not of that matters. It's because we're so much alike. At the end of the day, I always get a hug from them. They say, 'I love you.' It's huge." Len, a Webster resident, founded the brewery with his long-time neighbor, George Cline. Cline's family also works at the brewery. Knucklehead is planning a big blowout for their first anniversary party in December. I've come away impressed with Knucklehead's beers on my previous visits. Each of the beers is well-executed and clean. I might not like how big some of the hoppy beers are in the malt backbone, but I can appreciate a well-crafted beer that is sure to please a wide audience. Knucklehead's most recent seasonal beer is a winner. The Dark Shadow is a maple syrup vanilla bean porter that screams to be enjoyed with pancakes. You could probably substitute the beer for your maple syrup and come away pretty darn happy. At 7.4 percent alcohol, it's a really nice fall beer. The maple treatment, brewed with gallons of New York dark maple syrup (added after the boil to preserve maximum viscosity and maple flavor), is outstanding. I would've liked a tad more body and a tad more roasted malt character, but it's the first time Knucklehead has done the beer and I know it will be heartier in the future. Len Dummer told me that there are more plans to use more vanilla beans in the future. That would compliment the maple flavor perfect. As it stands now, you get a kiss of vanilla in the finish. But more would definitely help. Webster has embraced Knucklehead. I have, too. It took me too long to make a return visit, but you can be assured that I will return soon (especially with the kitchen, which features housemade soups, paninis, sandwiches, and pretzels, now open). Dummer is one of those people that you instantly connect with, and it's probably what makes him such a natural to own a brewery. He's always quick with a joke. He's always smiling, and it's probably why his patrons have embraced Knucklehead. "When people ask me what's my favorite thing, I love making beer, I love making friends, I love making our customers happy, I love creating a good environment, but it's all about family. That's the biggest bang for my buck. WCLEVELAND@Gannett.com
Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) Is Going Nowhere. Here's Why. Sales at America's automakers have been going great guns these past few quarters, and you'd think that would be great news for the companies that make parts for all these shiny new autos. In some cases, you'd be right to think that. But in at least one case — the case of Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI) stock — you'd be very, very wrong. Shares of auto-parts makers such as Lear (NYSE:LEA) and Magna International (NYSE:MGA) have rocketed this past year, outperforming the S&P 500 with 46% and 56% returns, respectively. Yet Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI) stock has lagged the market average by more than five points. Why? Three reasons. Johnson Controls stock is worse than average Turns out that when you stack up Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI) stock against its two smaller rivals, there's precious little to recommend it. Johnson Controls' P/E ratio of 27.8 is no bargain. It's more than twice the cost of a share of Magna (which costs 10.5 times earnings), and nearly six times the cost of Lear, which sells for only 4.7 times earnings. Worse, when you lay the three companies side-by-side, you can plainly see that Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI) generates far less real cash profit than its rivals do. Its free cash flow yield is the worst of the bunch: JCI Free Cash Flow Yield data by YCharts Johnson Controls grows too slow Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI) stock is no great shakes when valued on more traditional "GAAP" earnings, either. Fact is, over the past five years Johnson Controls stock is the only one of the three that has seen earnings actually decline: Johnson Controls stock is going nowhere Of course, there's still the old investing truism to consider — that investing isn't about what a stock has done in the past, but what it might do in the future. Problem is, despite the shrinking earnings that are giving it a smaller earnings base to grow from in the future, Johnson Controls stock is still expected to be the slowest grower of the group: So once again, we find Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI) stock occupying last place in a losing race. Johnson Controls Inc (JCI)Lear Corp (LEA)Magna International Inc (MGA)NYSE:JCINYSE:LEANYSE:MGAShow more...Show less Johnson Controls, Inc.

How many playbooks do I need? Hi all, first time posting here, and, I'm still very new to PbtA, but, I've played Dungeon World, ran a teeny tiny bit of Urban Shadows, and have been reading AW. I'm starting a PbtA hack, as I really love to work with game systems and build on them, and am going to start running it for my meatspace group soon, I have enough of it functional for them to dive into, but, I'm running into an issue of, AW has soooo many playbooks, to really give enough options for different characters, it seems like I should have a similar number. I have 7 playbooks mostly nailed down (though I expect them to go through changes), but, that feels like not enough to avoid eventually having a lot of overlap in characters because there's just not that much to choose from. I can kinda think of a potential number 8 & maybe 9, but, beyond that, really not coming to me for this game. So, is there an ideal number of playbooks? Is 7 or even 9 really just not enough variety? Should I be stressing about this? Re: How many playbooks do I need? I could see a game with just 4 playbooks, if that game is about just playing those 4 archetypes. 7 playbooks widen the field, but is still pretty focused. Players have a choice when the game starts, but there is not a lot of choices if they can change playbooks during play (can they change playbooks during play?) Though this also depends on how flexible the playbooks are. Can a player pick the same playbook as another player, and most of the time not be stepping on that player's toes? Original AW has 11 playbooks (if I'm counting correctly), with 5+ more extended playbooks. They run the gamut from hyper-violent to very social, from loner to leader to team player. So even if they aren't that flexible, you can play a lot of different scenarios. Main thing is I have 6 players (and an extra that occasionally visits when we have an extra seat open), but... they like to sometimes switch up characters too, which makes it possibly a bigger issue if I really want niche protection. Anyhow, good to know it isn't like there's some established minimum that there really needs to be beyond maybe 4, and I suppose with a group like this perhaps I'll have to accept some overlap for a while. I'll try not to stress on it. I'm starting to have more ideas come to mind... wrote another playbook today and realised I could actually go in some very different directions with this than what I was initially thinking. If I was designing something for a specific bunch of players, and giving them the choice of finished playbooks (rather than designing specific characters with/for each of them) then I'd try to make sure I had half again as many playbooks as players, so they get the illusion of choice, while making sure that whatever combination they chose produced a viable party. That's tricky in abstract, because a group of six bricks doesn't work, and a team without a brick might struggle - but since you know your players you can cheat a little. For a specific group I'd go with working with them to make specific (and clearly different) archetypes using Simpleworld. If you are looking for an excuse and a deadline to make a hack, then what I do is choose the stats, than generate every permutation of major and minor stats for a playbook. So 2 stats means four playbooks, 3 stats means 9 (which is what I used - Fighter, Thief and Wizard).

Binocular Waves is an artistic research project about binocular vision – being able to see with two eyes. The project explores what happens when we present two different images to left and right eye using a VR Headset. Depending on their similarities and differences these two images fuse, compete or coexist in the conscious visual perception creating different binocular phenomena. Here you can watch my presentation on Binocular Waves which was made at International Symposium on Electronic Arts 2018 in Durban, South Africa. Binocular Waves focuses on artistic exploitation of this phenomena and tries to create inspiration for scientific research on vision and on consciousness. Binocular Dreams, experiment to reproduce dream phenomena, such as dream elements with multiple identities, so called "interobjects", by presenting each identity of the element to another eye. Binocular Rivers, exploring new ways of animated painting, playing with movement and time using stereoscopic imagery. All animation videos in these series are stereoscopic 360° animation videos. This means that each one of these animations is consisting of two separate 360° videos for left and right eyes. "Binocular disparity" is difference of image location of an object seen by the left and right eyes, resulting from the distance between two eyes (parallax) and makes the perception of depth (stereopsis) possible. However, when two significantly different images are presented to left and right eyes one of the following perception phenomena may occur: a) "Binocular Fusion" two images are perceived as an averaged merge of two. b) "Binocular Transparency" they merge into a superimposition. c) "Binocular Rivalry" the images compete and alternate in perceptual awareness. The work is the result of a long observation quastioning process. From early childhood on my left and right has strong myopia and astigmatism with different diopter levels. I had also two surgical retinal and lens interventions on my left eye resulting from injury. The interventions resulted into more differences between my left and right eye vision. This phenomenon made me curious whether images with interocular differences can be reproduced in visual art. I think this research can make the impairment and the improvement of vision with interocular differences perceivable for people without significant differences.

Reflexology is based on the principle that reflex points on the soles, tops, and sides of the feet correspond to different areas of the body. In this way, the feet can be seen as a 'map' of the body. By applying specialised massage techniques to specific reflex points – using the thumbs, fingers and knuckles – the aim of a reflexology treatment is to help restore balance to the body naturally, and improve the client's general well-being. We start with a full consultation, asking various questions about your health and lifestyle, to ensure reflexology is right for you. For the treatment itself you will remain fully clothed, simply removing your shoes and socks. You'll be invited to relax on a reclining chair or treatment couch, or to put your feet up on a footstool. We will gently clean your feet before applying a fine powder, cream of oil, to help provide a free-flowing treatment, and then start gently massaging and stretching your feet and ankles. As the treatment progresses, a variety of different reflexology techniques will be used to 'work' the reflex points on each foot, including a caterpillar-like movement called 'thumb walking'. The areas treated and pressure applied will be adapted to suit your individual needs. Treatment generally lasts for 45 minutes to an hour, though shorter reflexology sessions may be more appropriate in some instances.

Photo: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Esther Fung BiographyEsther Fung @estherfung Dec. 13, 2015 11:01 am ET SHANGHAI—China is trying to alleviate a pair of knotty problems—population pressure on its biggest cities and a glut of new homes elsewhere—by getting smaller urban areas to offer housing discounts to attract migrants from the countryside. Encouraged by Beijing, some local governments are rolling out a range of housing subsidies, tax waivers and lower mortgage rates to attract new residents. In Fuyang, an urban district near the well-off eastern provincial capital of Hangzhou, the government is providing a one-time housing subsidy of as much as 800,000 yuan ($123,874) for new residents with certain qualifications who buy homes in the area. The central city of Luoyang is subsidizing deed tax payments and mortgage costs for rural migrants buying homes in the city. The push by Beijing is intended to address a problem that has cropped up in recent years as people leave the countryside for the cities for work: Most want to go to the largest, most prosperous cities, putting a strain on infrastructure and services in those places. Meanwhile, large parts of the rest of the country are overbuilt. A result of this divergence is that, while property prices are recovering in Beijing, Shanghai and some other major cities, years of overbuilding plague most other urban areas and amount to a sizable drag on the economy. "It is becoming clear to Chinese officials that the property sector still retains an important role in stabilizing the economy," said Chen Sheng, who heads the government-backed China Real Estate Data Academy. "The idea is to stabilize, not to overly stimulate the economy." While housing sales have rebounded this year, investment in real-estate development has slowed to 1.3% in the first 11 months this year from the same period a year earlier, while construction starts declined 14.7% over the same period. Last month, President Xi Jinping told a meeting of economic and financial officials that China must resolve the housing inventory situation and ensure the health of the property sector. The efforts to divert rural migrants to smaller cities comes amid a renewed effort by Beijing to improve the treatment given to rural migrants. The State Council, the government's executive body, over the weekend issued new guidelines for local governments, telling them to offer a more comprehensive package of benefits, from housing loans to social services, to incoming residents, who may not have the proper household registration documents, known as a hukou. The hukou system was imposed decades ago to keep rural Chinese out of cities, when China was much poorer. It has evolved into a benefits management system, defining access to health care, employment, education and other social benefits. Typically those benefits are better for those with an urban hukou, and the current system has been widely criticized as unfair by often denying holders of a rural hukou access to those services in the cities to which they move. Smaller cities have in the past tried to draw in rural migrants by offering them urban hukou. But still migrants have preferred larger cities with more vibrant job markets. And some analysts have said that cities will have to do more than offer lower housing prices. Liu Dan, a Hangzhou-based fashion designer in her mid-20s, says that apart from housing costs, she will have to assess job prospects, social networks and proximity to her family in the northwestern region of Xinjiang before considering settling down in a city. "It is about being familiar with a place," said Ms Liu, who has worked in Shanghai and Qingdao before. "I've been in Hangzhou for more than a year now, but I'm still not used to this place." Some analysts have voiced skepticism that urbanization will cure China's housing surplus, noting that in some places, it is becoming more difficult to get rural dwellers to uproot themselves. "There is a perception that there isn't much benefit moving into the city," said Song Huiyong, research director at property consultancy Shanghai Centaline Property, adding that smaller housing units and mediocre employment prospects stemming from a slowing economy deter them too. "They also know their rural land is worth more now, and are unwilling to give up those rights." Many of these subsidies are temporary, lasting only a few months as questions remain on how local governments could raise money to foot the bill for these costs. Some local governments have also asked state-owned firms and financial institutions including policy banks to help with these costs. Write to Esther Fung at esther.fung@wsj.com

Cut my legs off and call me shorty! is an exhibition that explores elements of humour and surprise. The five Swedish based artists included work with ideas and ways of making that force us to look and look again. Opening at June 17th! Exhibition period: June 17th - September 19th 2009 Cut my legs off and call me shorty! is an exhibition that explores elements of humour and surprise. The thirteen Swedish based artists included work with ideas and ways of making that force us to look and look again. We may think we have understood an image but when we allow ourselves a closer examination there are unexpected twists, shocking details, hidden pratfalls, double and triple meanings. The exhibition is in two parts there are 5 artists showing in the main hall who work with photography, painting and illustration: * Susanna Hesselberg * Ulf Lundin * Emma Rendel * Ulla West * Kristoffer Zetterstrand Ulla West uses a mix of old and new technology in her work including fine art techniques, craft practices as well as new media. Her methods are documentary, they are investigations related to phenomenon, situations or things that just occur. Associations and unexpected ideas are important in the process. Often her art projects start as an investigation and documentation with the purpose to relate to a certain situation or as a way to handle everyday life. The work itself often leads to unexpected materials, ideas and collaborations and the projects can last for years. Kristoffer Zetterstrand has always worked in painting and more recently has begun to experiment with virtual still lifes and how two-dimensionality works in relation to computer generated 3D worlds. He is interested in spaces that are created online, in computer games and 3D programs - particularly when illusions begin to break down and the underlying construction is revealed - like when the program encounters a bug. His work has also found him looking at the relations of virtuality to the iconic works of Piero della Francesca, Giovanni Bellini and other renaissance artists. Emma Rendel is one of the most distinctive graphic artists working today. Her graphic novels have been published by her own publishing company Awkwardbooks and by Jonathan Cape in England and Kartago in Sweden. Her storytelling finds its origins in fragments she overhears, memories from childhood, and stories that people tell her. Her narratives are often dark and filled with a morbid curiosity as well as a cutting sense of humour. Ulf Lundin's work can be characterised by an extreme attention to detail and a fascination with how the process of photography captures a moment. Whilst the contents of his work may often been seen as mundane or commonplace the works become magical, extraordinary, fantastic and painterly. In a similar vein his videos deal with daily routines and every day social conditions raised to a level of the remarkable and the peculiar. Susanna Hesselberg originally trained as a painter and she brings much of that attention and aesthetic sensibility to her photographic work. Often working with careful constructed staging and manufactured props Hesselberg uses the power of photographic manipulation but without resorting to computer graphics. The results are often disturbing disruptions in the flow of everyday life often focusing on interpersonal relationships and the body. The second part of the exhibition is a selection of Swedish video art curated by Gunnel Pettersson in association with Film Form and includes works from 1962 - 2009 and includes: Henrik Andersson, Reuben Henry, Tove Kjellmark, Karin Kihlberg, Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd, Malin Skjöld, Per Teljer, Christine Ödlund We have taken the following quote by American writer E.B. White as good advice for the show. "Analyzing humour is like dissecting a frog. Few people are interested and the frog dies of it".

Jimmy Olsen as the Guardian Revealed in 'Supergirl' Season 2 Jimmy Olsen as the Guardian Revealed in Supergirl Season 2 — October 12th, 2016 The Supergirl Season 2 Premiere on The CW set a ratings record for the network on Monday night, setting the tone for the season ahead. During a press screening for the second episode on Tuesday, executive producer Andrew Kreisberg revealed that Mehcad Brooks' Jimmy Olsen will in fact become the DC Comics hero The Guardian, signalling yet another big shift between Jimmy's character in the comics and the series. Earlier today, Mehcad Brooks himself took to social media, to give fans the first look at Jimmy suited up as The Guardian. This new Instagram photo reveals that The Guardian costume will be much different than the comics as well. The character was originally created by Jack Kirby and Joe Simon, portrayed as a Metropolis cop named Jim Harper who covered the Suicide Slum section of the city, before he became a vigilante to protect the city from its criminals. Andrew Kriesberg teased at yesterday's screening (via TV Line), that he won't be telling Kara Zor-El (Melissa Benoist) his secret. Here's what he had to say below. "James is going to decide that he can no longer be a sidekick, so he's going to become a vigilante. He's going to become Guardian, complete with the shield, which is going to cause a massive problem in his relationship with Kara because he decides not to tell her. There's this new masked vigilante, and she has her own feelings about vigilantes. ... And he's recruited Winn to help him. Winn is his man in the van. Winn and James together is like comedy gold." This comes after the events in the season premiere, where both Kara ended her romantic relationship with Jimmy, which will certainly become more complicated with Jimmy keeping this vigilante secret from Kara. When asked why they decided to put an end to the Jimmy Olsen romance, Andrew Kreisberg said they were pursuing that relationship for the wrong reasons. Here's what he had to say below. Related: Jon Cryer as Lex Luthor Revealed in Supergirl Season 4 "We sort of felt like we were pursuing that relationship more because we felt like we had to than any of us was really truly feeling it. We realized the best scenes between them were the nice, sweet scenes where they were being friends." While we don't know exactly when they will happen yet, Supergirl will be involved in two different crossovers this season, one with Arrow, The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow, where all four heroes will face The Dominators, and a musical crossover with The Flash. We also don't know when Jimmy Olsen will transform into The Guardian, but we'll keep you posted with more details.

Rye motel to undergo 'authentic 1950s renovation' Elizabeth Dinan edinan@seacoastonline.com @DinanElizabeth RYE�� Four months after opening his fourth local hotel, Doug Palardy announced he's buying the Pebble Cove Motel on Ocean Boulevard, it will undergo "an authentic 1950s renovation," then reopen July 1 as the Rye Motor Inn & Swim Club. "I've always loved design," said Palardy, whose interiors lean toward modern, even when they're in historic buildings. "I studied theatrical design, sets and costumes, at Bennington College, so design is really part of my DNA since childhood." Palardy said he's had his eye on the 10-room 1958 motel for five years and asked owners Stephen and Beth McCann annually if they'd sell. After a quarter century of running the 741 Ocean Blvd. motel, the McCanns said yes. Now plans call for Palardy's makeover to an authentic "60s beach, surf, bungalow vibe." He's thinking about rattan beds, velvet and Eames-style chairs, and kitschy kitchenettes; all sustenance for future Instagram-hungry guests. He'll keep the 1950s and 60s color schemes and the furniture will be new, but in the style of 1958 through 1963. "That's the five-year period of interior design I'm going for," he said. "I grew up in a 1960s mobile home in Vermont with wood-panel walls. My mother hated them, but now I want to bring them back here.�� His Rye motel plans are similar to new retro destinations including The Thunderbird Inn in Savannah, Georgia, and The Dive Motel in Nashville, Tennessee. Palardy previously renovated the former Bow Street Inn into the Ale House Inn and the former Sise Inn into the Hotel Portsmouth, then sold both. He currently owns and operates the six-suite Great Island Inn in New Castle, where the decor is coastal Scandinavian, inside an 1820 home he renovated across from the Town Hall. In August, he announced the opening of The Inn Downtown, with urban decor inside the 1809 Nutter-Rymes House, formerly the Blue Mermaid, in downtown Portsmouth's The Hill neighborhood, comprised of homes salvaged from urban renewal demolition.� He said he's now thrilled to be planning a vintage makeover, to a mid-century space, as a preservation project for "one of the last motels in Rye." "Most on the Seacoast are getting leveled for condos or other uses," Palardy said. "We bulldoze things from the 50s, 60s and 70s without even thinking about their historic significance. I think it's important to save something like this, from this era. Once they're gone, they're gone." Like The Inn Downtown, the reimagined Rye motel will be a continuation of his apart-hotel brand, Seacoast Apart-Hotels. They feature self check-in and check-out, all units equipped with kitchens and the feeling of being in an apartment. It will be open year-round and the pool will be heated to extend the swimming season beyond that in the nearby Atlantic and "bring people to Rye beyond July and August," he said. Palardy said travelers today rarely book week-long stays and younger travelers prefer short-stay road trips. He said the Rye Motor Inn & Swim Club will allow guests to drive up and stay for a day, weekend or longer. Car clubs, families and groups of friends can book the whole motel and "have the pool to yourself," he said. Palardy said he's seeking town approval to open an adults-only membership swim club for local residents he'd run through an app-based reservation sign-up model. Reservations would be made for specific time slots, reserve parking spaces and several locals have already asked about a seasonal membership, he said. He also plans to seek town approval to return a neon sign to the site, which he said was there during the motel's heyday. He said the sign will be larger than what's there now, but it would be an historically accurate addition to his renovation. "It's been a passion of mine to renovate a 1950s motel," he said. "We fetishize architecture that's over 100 years old on the Seacoast, but in another 40 years, this little motel will be 100 years old. It deserves to be saved." Progress of the motel's makeover will be posted to Instagram @ryemotorinn and at ryemotorinn.com.
Q: How to git clone with username and password in gitlab? I am using gitlab . I want to write a .bat file which contains all the steps so that I can automate all the process , which are as follows: * *open cmd.exe /k *git init *git clone https://username:password@gitlab.com/board.git ////// not working *git status The 3rd point that is git clone https.... is not working in gitBash anymore. I tried using git clone SSH ... and it is working which asked for the passphrase and after logging in it was about to clone the repo. As I want to automate the process by providing the login credentials by-default , how can it be achieved using SSH. Thank you. A: You will need to use access token. Gitlab doesn't allow to use password directly. git clone https://<username>:<token>@gitlab.com/group/project.git To create a Gitlab access token: * *Click your avatar at the top right corner, select Edit profile *On the left panel, select Access Tokens *Input the Token name and Expiration date (if any) *Check the read_repository checkbox *Click Create personal access token *Remember to save the access token, it appears only once A: Adding username before gitlab worked for me. It will ask password afterwards. git clone https://user@gitlab.com/project.git A: While generating keys I did give a passphrase. Simplest solution would be to generate key without passphrase and use it. Git clone over https should work but url from your example looks wrong. Go to your project page, choose Clone -> HTTPS url which should look like https://gitlab.com/<username or groupname>/<projectname>.git Let's say it is your user's private project and your user would be Julie, then url with credentials would be https://user:password@gitlab.com/julie/board.git Test url manually before you start writing your script. So going to your script example don't init anything just do for https clone: git clone https://user:password@gitlab.com/julie/board.git cd board git status or if you create ssh key without passphrase and set it on GitLab: git clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab.com/julie/board.git cd board git status

The slump of a shoulder; the twitch of a lip; a certain gaze. Some actions say it all without the need for words. But when so much daily human connection and communication occurs on this substratum of silence, what can we learn from what's left unsaid? It's a question for Valerie Manusov, a professor in the University of Washington's Department of Communication. Since joining the UW in 1993, she has studied how nonverbal actions affect interpersonal communications and, on a deeper level, how such discourse represents particular views about the nature of relationships and cultural values. "Some nonverbal behaviors are pragmatic—such as scratching an itch—but all of them can be given multiple meanings or mean multiple things," she says. In other words, when a friend or partner shifts positions on the couch, that movement could be from a desire to simply be more comfortable or due to the fact they had a bad day and want more personal space. But what Manusov says is often most telling—and consequently of most interest to her as a researcher—is how the other person sharing that space perceives that shift in position. Manusov says one of the challenges of her work as a professor who researches communication is establishing a method to understanding meaning: where it lies and how it is ascribed. Last year, Manusov taught graduate and undergraduate classes in nonverbal communication. This quarter, she is teaching a graduate class on interpersonal communication as well as the Communication Department undergraduate honors seminar—a program she also leads. "It's a sort of activism to try to help people see the role that they're playing in how they understand the world and how their own biases and narratives and perceptions about the world affecting how a situation or person is judged," she says. Another hurdle to that end is that people often feel they've been "communicating" their entire lives and consequently are not keen on taking on the topic in what Manusov believes is its deservedly more complex context. When people do begin to adopt a more mindful, introspective approach to communication, however, the outcomes are almost universally of great benefit. She came to study "mindfulness" almost by accident, after using the term in a paper on civility and the self. "I was interested in whether increases in mindfulness mean that we're less likely to jump to conclusions about nonverbal cues and more likely to stay more open to what something may mean so that we're less reactive to it," she says. An interest in this interplay of relationship and reaction is what led Manusov to study communication in the first place. Growing up in Los Angeles, she attended Venice High School—at the time the third-most naturally desegregated school in the U.S. But even with a student body reflective of Southern California's natural diversity of cultures, that didn't necessarily mean there weren't cultural cliques and preconceptions to be overcome. "With a lot of cultural diversity, we were faced at a relatively early age with some of the challenges of communicating across difference," she says. One of the ways the administration addressed those challenges was by holding a weekend-long mountain retreat for students each semester. The experience in turn influenced her decision to study communication as a freshman at UCLA, where she recalls being one of the few students at the school not actively studying to be news anchors. Eschewing mass communication, she was a part of a dedicated minority whose interests lay in communication's interpersonal side. Manusov found some perspective abroad, studying in Leeds, England as an undergraduate before returning to the north of England for two years after finishing her master's at Michigan state—teaching for two years in Sheffield before embarking on her Ph.D. For Manusov, the region's distinctive dialects and long-held cultural mores opened up a world of communicative nuance. Fascinating as it was, however, the region was caught in the economic turmoil in the wake of by Margaret Thatcher's government's attempt to close most of Britain's collieries and the miners' strike that followed 1984-85—widely deemed the most bitter industrial dispute in British history. It's a lesson that still informs Manusov's work to this day and one she says she sees as relevant to the present as it felt in Yorkshire three decades ago: many perspectives make up a conversation, but in order for it to be both constructive and instructive, it's important to be mindful about where, how, and why meaning can be missed or misconstrued. "It's really important to stop and look at what's going on within us that's making us react the way that we are." In the matter of articulating a more open and understanding future, it might be that a thoughtful silence speaks loudest of all. Valerie Manusov holds a B.A. in Communication from UCLA, a Master's in Communication from Michigan State, and Ph.D. in Communication from the University of Southern California. She is the co-editor of The Sage Handbook of Nonverbal Communication, and the editor or co-editor of two other volumes, The sourcebook of nonverbal measures: Going beyond words and Attribution, communication behavior, and close relationships. In 2008, she co-founded Hestia Retreat, a Vashon Island-based nonprofit that provides seasonal retreats and other opportunities for women, often free of charge.

Daily Correspondents UN House in Abuja returns to life eight years after Boko Haram attack Almost eight years after Boko Haram bombed the United Nations' House in Abuja, forcing the world body to abandon the place, agencies of the world body are gradually returning to the building, the UN Resident Coordinator, Edward Kallon has disclosed. Boko Haram insurgents had on Friday, 26 of August, 2011, bombed the UN building in Abuja, with a car bomb killing at least 21 and wounding 60 others in the process. Mr Kallon, who made the disclosure Wednesday in Abuja at an event to commemorate the 73rd Anniversary of the UN day, described the movement back to the UN House as a demonstration of the shared resilience of the UN and Nigeria against increasing violence and terrorism. "The 2018 UN Day is a very important day for the UN system in Nigeria as it underscores the excellent cooperation and partnership of the UN and Nigeria over the years. "Indeed this year's UN Day also marks the UN family partial move back to the UN House. "To the UN in Nigeria, the UN House is a symbol of the resilience of our extraordinary cooperation and partnership with the Government and people of Nigeria," he said. He explained that the UN building built by the Federal Government was occupied by the UN agencies in 2005 until the unfortunate bombing on Aug. 26, 2011. While he commended the Federal Government and the people of Nigeria for their commitment to rebuild the UN House, the envoy expressed the hope that the partial movement which commences with UNDP, UNICEF among others would inspire the staff to work better. The Minister of FCT, Mohammed Bello, described the event as significant as it marked the first time of gathering again at the building after the 2011 bombing of the place "The UN building stands out as the symbol of our resilience and unbroken promises in addressing various challenges we are facing as a nation," he said. The Minister who was represented by Umar Jubril, an official of the Ministry, congratulated the UN family on the return to the edifice, and assured them of their safety.

Trump will meet with his fellow heads of state and government from across the NATO alliance in Brussels, Belgium, and there is widespread concern that it will once again be a meeting where the United States is scornful of its allies and partners. Some even fear that this may be the beginning of the end of NATO and the bond between the United States and Europe. The flames have been fanned further by the recent G-7 meeting which ended in acrimony between the US president and the other leaders, the announced Trump-Putin summit in Helsinki a few days after the NATO summit, and whispers that the United States may pull its troops out of Germany in the coming years. Trump has, going back to when he was a Republican primary candidate, criticized NATO's members for not doing their fair share in terms of spending on defense, and stated that the Europeans get more out of NATO than the United States does. The president does indeed have a point when it comes to European defense spending, which has been in decline since the early 1990s, although it is again on the rise since 2014. And the uptick in European defense spending is something that the president could arguably take partial credit for, if he wished. But NATO is not about the United States doing Europe favors. It is an alliance created by the United States, and which has proven remarkably effective in transforming to, in great part, advancing American national security objectives. During the Cold War NATO stood as the bulwark against the Soviet Union in Europe during the multi-decade struggle between communism and the free world led by the United States. After the Cold War, NATO helped advance the vision set out by US President George H.W. Bush of a Europe whole, free, and at peace by inviting newly free countries of Eastern Europe to join the Alliance. And after the 9/11 attacks in the United States, NATO transformed again to take on the tough mission in Afghanistan alongside the United States. Well over a thousand non-US NATO soldiers lost their lives in that campaign. As a proportion of deployed forces, four NATO nations—Canada, the United Kingdom, Estonia, and Denmark—sustained higher casualty rates in Afghanistan than the United States did. NATO is also useful to the United States, even when the Alliance itself is not centrally involved in an operation. The US-led campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) includes contributions from a range of NATO allies. Over a third of the air strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Libya have been flown by NATO partner countries, something that is made possible by the habits of cooperation established and practiced inside NATO. The United States' European allies certainly do need to spend more on defense, and the president should push them to do it. But that is not to say that NATO is a burden for the United States. It has proven itself key to American national security objectives since the late 1940s. It is, after all, the United States' alliance.

Q: All data in a row. Move observations under each other I have the following data: data <- list(list(eventId = 8, subEventName = "Simple pass", tags = list( list(id = 1801)), playerId = 122671, positions = list(list( y = 50, x = 50), list(y = 53, x = 35)), matchId = 2057954, eventName = "Pass", teamId = 16521, matchPeriod = "1H", eventSec = 1.656214, subEventId = 85, id = 258612104), list(eventId = 8, subEventName = "High pass", tags = list(list(id = 1801)), playerId = 139393, positions = list( list(y = 53, x = 35), list(y = 19, x = 75)), matchId = 2057954, eventName = "Pass", teamId = 16521, matchPeriod = "1H", eventSec = 4.487814, subEventId = 83, id = 258612106)) I want to create a data frame out of this list. I use unlist(data), which creates a row with repeated variables. > unlist(data) eventId subEventName tags.id playerId positions.y positions.x positions.y "8" "Simple pass" "1801" "122671" "50" "50" "53" positions.x matchId eventName teamId matchPeriod eventSec subEventId "35" "2057954" "Pass" "16521" "1H" "1.656214" "85" id eventId subEventName tags.id playerId positions.y positions.x "258612104" "8" "High pass" "1801" "139393" "53" "35" positions.y positions.x matchId eventName teamId matchPeriod eventSec "19" "75" "2057954" "Pass" "16521" "1H" "4.487814" subEventId id "83" "258612106" Each observation starts with the eventId variable. So, basically I have to split the data into dataframes starting with eventId, and then moving those dataframes one under the other. I.e. having two observations in this case. Do you have any idea? thanks in advance A: Try tibblify-- library(tibblify) tibblify(data) ## A tibble: 2 x 12 # eventId subEventName tags playerId positions matchId eventName teamId matchPeriod eventSec subEventId id # <dbl> <chr> <list<tbl_df[,1]>> <dbl> <list<tbl_df[,2]>> <dbl> <chr> <dbl> <chr> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> #1 8 Simple pass [1 x 1] 122671 [2 x 2] 2057954 Pass 16521 1H 1.66 85 258612104 #2 8 High pass [1 x 1] 139393 [2 x 2] 2057954 Pass 16521 1H 4.49 83 258612106 A: You can use rbindlist from data.table : result <- data.table::rbindlist(data) result # eventId subEventName tags playerId positions matchId eventName teamId matchPeriod eventSec subEventId id #1: 8 Simple pass <list[1]> 122671 <list[2]> 2057954 Pass 16521 1H 1.66 85 2.59e+08 #2: 8 Simple pass <list[1]> 122671 <list[2]> 2057954 Pass 16521 1H 1.66 85 2.59e+08 #3: 8 High pass <list[1]> 139393 <list[2]> 2057954 Pass 16521 1H 4.49 83 2.59e+08 #4: 8 High pass <list[1]> 139393 <list[2]> 2057954 Pass 16521 1H 4.49 83 2.59e+08 A: Does this help solve your problem? df <- data.frame(matrix(unlist(data), nrow=length(data), byrow=T))

We have many public domain and commercial software packages installed on our systems, which are available to all users. However, users are allowed to download and install software packages in their own home directory, software usually only useful to them personally. There are a number of steps needed to install software. The make program gets its set of compile rules from a text file called Makefile which resides in the same directory as the source files. It contains information on how to compile the software, e.g. the compiler to use, the optimization level, whether to include debugging info in the executable, etc.. It also contains information on where to install the finished compiled binaries (executables), manual pages, data files, dependent library files, configuration files, etc. Some packages require you to edit the Makefile manually to set the final installation directory and any other parameters. However, many packages are now being distributed with the GNU configure utility. As the number of UNIX variants increased, it became harder to write programs which would be portable to all variants. Developers frequently did not have access to every system, and the characteristics of some systems changed from version to version. The GNU configure and build system simplifies the building of programs distributed as source code. All programs are built using a simple, standardized, two step process. The program builder need not install any special tools in order to build the program. cd to the directory containing the package's source code. Optionally, type make clean to remove the program binaries and object files from the source code directory. The configure utility supports a wide variety of options. You can usually use the --help option to get a list of interesting options for a particular configure script. The only generic options you are likely to use are the --prefix and --exec-prefix options. These options are used to specify the installation directories. The directory named by the --prefix option will hold machine independent files such as documentation, data and configuration files. The directory named by the --exec-prefix option, (which is normally a subdirectory of the --prefix directory), will hold machine dependent files such as executables. This will install the files into the ~/units-1.7.4 directory you created earlier. As an example, convert 6 feet to meters. If you get the answer 1.8288, congratulations, it worked. Type ^c to exit the program. As you can see, the file is now 36 kbytes - a third of its original size. Two thirds of the binary file was debug code!!!
The football and netball trip to Barcelona at the start of the Easter break was a huge success. Ninety students from Years 7-13 travelled to Spain where they enjoyed specialised training, lots of competitive match play, a tour of Nou Camp Stadium, the opportunity to watch a professional game and time to explore both Barcelona and Girona. The newsletter for the spring term 2019 can be downloaded here. As always there has been so much going on at Ruskin - we hope you enjoy reading about some of the highlights. On 25th March , a group of 69 Year 7 students went on a French trip to the Opal Coast in Northern France for 3 days. On 13th March, Year 8 French students left the Academy in the early hours of the morning for a 3 day trip to Paris. The visit was packed with excursions such as the Arc de Triomphe, a trip to the top of the Montparnasse Tower, a stop at the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa, a guided tour around Paris with entry to Notre Dame and the Fragonard Perfumerie where students were shown how perfume was made. On Wednesday 13th March a group of keen Ruskin Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths students visited the NEC to attend The Big Bang Show. The students engaged in and enjoyed many 'hands on' opportunities provided by dozens of universities, businesses, colleges and schools from around the country. From coding to building air powered dragsters with the Bloodhound Land Speed Record Team, from medical procedures to working in deep sea conditions with members of the Armed Forces, controlling lunar vehicles a million miles away to finding out how far it is possible to travel on one litre of petrol. Our annual SOS fashion show, held on Monday 4th March, was a well-attended and fun filled evening as always. With all proceeds from ticket sales going to Fairview Farm (Grantham and District Mencap), we were delighted to welcome some residents and members of staff to the event. Ruskin's termly PSHE day took place on Wednesday 6th March. Students were all off their normal timetables and instead engaged in a wide variety of important and relevant topics specific to their age group. Deforestation, addiction, Brexit, overcoming adversity, importance of sleep, teamwork, democracy, healthy lifestyles, setting up a company….all angles of life were covered. Year 11 photographers recently returned from Kenya. From the Great Rift Valley and Lake Nakuru to the incredible Masai Mara you cannot fail to be touched by the genuine warmth and friendliness of the Kenyan people, the vast stunning landscapes that take your breath away and the spectacular wildlife that is unrivalled anywhere else in the world - a photographers dream! Ruskin GCSE and A Level geographers headed to Iceland at the start of February for a breath-taking trip that is sure to remain with them for many years to come. Iceland is one of the few places in the world where you can visit and interact with a tectonic plate boundary offering chances to study how tectonics operate and affect people's lives. During the trip they were able to visit and observe geographical processes across natural hazards, energy demands, coasts, rivers and physical geography topics, common to both the A Level and GCSE courses they are studying. The end of another busy term! We hope you enjoy reading our latest newsletter.
Horse Bandages and more. All at Horseland. • Improperly applied wraps can do a lot of damage, and if the wrap is too tight, the blood supply to the tendons in the back of the horse's leg is easily compromised if the wrap is too tight, if it is slips down or if it is applied with uneven pressure. • Practice getting the correct tension on the bandage because if it's too tight it can injure his tendons, but if it's too loose it will slip. • Choose the right bandage for the right circumstances. A horse needs a different bandage for the stall vs. when you're riding him. • Clean the section of the leg to be wrapped and then brush the hair so that it lies smoothly. Which direction you wrap a leg isn't critical, so pick which works for you, whether you're left- or right-handed. • Learn to judge where to start the outer bandage so that you finish wrapping at the top of the leg. Our range of leg bandages are available in 5 different brands and different materials.
Misappropriation of Trade Secrets RPNA attorneys keep business objectives on track when advising clients on the preservation and protection of trade secrets. Information is more mobile than ever. Turnover in staff at the highest levels, coupled with increasingly digitized or electronically stored data, makes the mass exodus of proprietary information very easy. Although trade secret laws are written specifically, they present far broader implications. In order to be legally classified a trade secret, intrinsic value must be established. In addition, reasonable measures to keep the trade secret—a secret—must be proven. RPNA's trade secret legal counsel spans the continuum of challenges that can and do arise when seeking to protect important trade secrets or corporate know how, such as the: Establishment of security measures to protect trade secrets Proactive hiring practices such as non-disclosure and non-compete agreements that comply with existing law Execution of immediate legal action to enforce trade secret rights when a violation occurs Litigation of trade secret theft can result in injunctions against violators, damages and considerable financial penalties. Whether our attorneys are called upon to execute cease and desist letters or to pursue damages and injunctive relief through litigation, trial or on appeal, the firm's attorneys are known for tough, highly exacting advocacy on behalf of our clients.

Baltimore news outlets have published body cam video from a supposed drug bust back in January. The video appears to show a cop planting drugs in a trash pile, before going back to the road, activating his body camera, and "finding" the drugs that supposedly belonged to a suspect. The cop was using a model of body cam that constantly captures and buffers footage, so that when you press the record button, it saves the previous 30 seconds of footage. The officer is seen "discovering" the bag of pills in record time, before coming back out to the road and turning the camera off. The drugs — and the officer's testimony of finding them — were to be used in a case against a suspect. After reviewing the video, a public defender brought up the apparent planting of evidence to the prosecutor in the case. Charges were subsequently dropped, and some kind of investigation is ongoing, although the Baltimore Police Department has refused further comment. Body cams have become more and more prevalent among cops in recent years, although policies around when they should be recorded and how evidence should be disclosed are still working out. Cases like this show how some police officers appear to be manipulating the cameras (however badly!) to try and manipulate evidence, showing that they're far from the perfect solution that some have hoped for.
Some Good News From Japan All of Japan's wind farms are unscathed by the 9.0 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown. Kelly Rigg of the Huffington Post contacted Yoshinori Ueda, leader of the International Committee of the Japan Wind Power Association & Japan Wind Energy Association to find out about how the tiny island nation's wind farms are holding up through the earthquake and tsunami. (Slave owner Ms Huffington really should pay her excellent journalists!) Ueda told her that there has been no wind damage reported by any association members, from either the earthquake or the tsunami. This would mean that all 9,997 MW of the nation's land-based wind energy is fine. Japan already had planned to bring off-shore wind capacity up to 1 GW (1,000 MW) by 2020. The first of these, the Kamisu (semi-offshore) wind farm, which was about 300km from the epicenter of the quake, survived. Its anti-earthquake "battle proof design" came through with flying colors. Not much comfort for a wonderful country that just lost 30% of its generating capacity from nuclear plants, I know, but that is something. And perhaps, out of the misfortune, a boost for clean energy in Japan. Mr. Ueda confirms that most Japanese wind turbines are fully operational and told her that electric companies have asked wind farm owners to step up operations as much as possible in order to make up for shortages in the eastern part of the country. No turning off these turbines because there's too much power on the grid.

• At 3:26 p.m. Central Montana Dispatch relayed a call about a possible rollover involving one of the Cheadle Fire Department's trucks. The sheriff's department failed to reach the fire department in person, but was able to leave a message on their phone. At 5:19 p.m. someone returned the message, reporting everything was okay. The caller said the vehicle had been parked too close to an edge and tipped over. • At 7:42 a.m. a caller reported a bear problem. He said three bears, possibly a sow and two cubs, had been in his yard earlier in the morning. The night before, his birdseed feeder had been knocked over. The caller informed dispatch a game warden had helped him with the same problem last year. • At 7 a.m. a man called in concerned about a loud noise. He heard a boom come from the direction of Casino Creek Concrete while walking his dog early that morning, and thought it sounded more like an explosion than a gunshot. At 7:50 a.m. a deputy drove out to the scene, and he advised dispatch he found the source of the sound: a firecracker. • At 9:12 p.m. Central Montana Dispatch informed the sheriff's department that Lewistown police officers were doing breathalyzer tests on several kids. A deputy responded.
Another season of BBC Radio 4's Dangerous Visions has begun airing. Programs are spread across three weeks, ending July 14. All dramas and readings will be available to listen to online for 30 days. You can also download each drama via the BBC iPlayer Radio app. This year, there's dystopian comedy in the mix, with two new productions. The first episode of Fahrenheit 451 is available July 3. Gregor Samsa's life is dominated by routine – commute, work, home – until one morning when he wakes to find himself transformed into a giant insect. As he attempts to master life with six legs, his family must also learn to live with his new look. In this drama, Kafka's masterpiece is given a modern twist with a darkly comic edge. Starring Tom Basden, Felicity Montagu, and Tim Key. In a vision of a world where antibiotics have stopped working and uncompromising, life-changing choices must be made, Anna is a doctor working in infectious diseases, forced every day to help choose whether to treat a patient or not. Those who do not have the correct insurance must face their fate with a shadowy judge called The Quartermaster. "Culture" was developed through the Wellcome Trust Experimental Stories scheme. Starring David Calder and Pippa Nixon. Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 was written in the early 1950s and is a dark, dystopian vision, set in a future American society where reading is outlawed. The role of the fireman has changed – his job now is to burn any books he finds. The main character Guy Montag is a fireman who starts to question his job, and his role as book eliminator begins to wrestle with his conscience. Poetic, dazzling and shocking: Ray Bradbury's vision of the future comes to Radio 4. This gripping three-part thriller takes place in France, 2020. In the picturesque town of Grenoble, the Front National sweeps to power in the municipal elections. As the euphoria of triumph is replaced by the bitter taste of reality, darkness descends on the city and there's trouble in the streets. Perimeter is the second comedy to feature in this year's dystopian feast and is set in a not-too-distant future, where the subtle differences to our society provide us with plenty of comic potential. In some ways things are worse e.g. environmental disaster; but in some ways things are better – more shows on Netflix. Siblings Josie and Liam live in a city divided into two zones by a giant, electrified fence. Inside the perimeter live people rich enough to afford the colossal property prices; outside is where everybody else lives. Close to the original book, Darkness at Noon is set in an unnamed country ruled by a totalitarian government (but basically, it's Stalin's Russia). Rubashov, once a powerful player in the regime, finds the tables turned on him when he is arrested and tried for treason. His reflections on his previous life and experiences in prison are at the heart of this thought-provoking masterpiece. Click here to see the schedule of upcoming episodes.

On Saturday, Brynn Paulin, Jennifer Armintrout, Cheryl Sterling and I gave a presentation at our local library as part of their Celebration of the Book festival. Our talk was supposed to be about the Diversity and Misconceptions of the Romance Genre, but we only touched on a few misconceptions before it turned into a writing workshop of sorts. Despite the fact that I would have liked to address more of the misconceptions, I consider the entire experience a rousing success anyway. We had a much larger audience than I'd expected including my baby sister, Cait who drove down from college to see us, and my littlest minion, An who called in sick to work to see us. I didn't throw up due to nerves. I think I only babbled incoherently twice – public speaking wigs me out and I occasionally say wildly inappropriate things. And best of all, the two snide questions regarding the validity of epubblishing and literary fiction vs. genre fiction were handled beautifully by Brynn and Jen respectively. Also, I think we might have garnered some potential members for out monthly RWA meetings. It was a gigantic blast and I LOVED blowing that e-publishing question out of the water. Hell no is e-pub failing and unsuccessful. What.EVER.It was a wonderful experience. Maybe we can doing it again next year…we can talk about basket making and maybe instead the topic will turn to Misconceptions *g*. Keep your notes!! And maybe we can "doing" my grammar too. Sheesh!!! I'm blaming my typos on the cold this morning. Bron, you and I would get along famously. I find myself babbling rather odd things a lot too. Irreverent, is what I call it. 🙂 I can be VERY irreverent. Definitely going to have to meet you. So….what did Brynn and Jen say about the whole epub thing and the literary vs. genre thing?My personal take on the second one: It Is Called Popular Fiction For A Reason!

Qatar Airways Resumes Flights to Budapest, Dar es Salaam, Dhaka, Istanbul and New York Özgür Töre The national carrier of the State of Qatar, Qatar Airways continues to maintain its position as the largest international carrier in the world, operating over 270 weekly flights to more than 45 destinations. The airline's gradual rebuilding of its network continues with flights resuming in the past week to the following destinations: Budapest (three weekly flights started 15 June) Dar es Salaam (three weekly flights started 16 June) Dhaka (three weekly flights started 15 June) Istanbul (daily flights started 13 June) New York (flights started 19 June, daily from 22 June and 10 weekly from 2 July) As entry restrictions ease around the world, the carrier is also seeing a rise in bookings due to the strong levels of trust built with passengers as it took home over 1.8 million people safely and reliably during this crisis including many left stranded by other airlines. With demand steadily rising, Qatar Airways has increased frequencies to the following destinations in the past week: Athens (increased from three weekly to daily flights) Dallas-Fort Worth (increased from three weekly to daily flights) Dublin (increased from five weekly to daily flights) Islamabad (now operating double daily flights) Jakarta (increased from four weekly to daily flights) Karachi (now operating double daily flights) Lahore (now operating double daily flights) Milan (increased from five weekly to daily flights) Rome (increased from six weekly to daily flights) Singapore (increasing from three weekly to daily flights) The national carrier of the State of Qatar also continues to operate daily flights to many key global destinations including Amsterdam, London Heathrow, Melbourne, Seoul, Sydney, Tokyo and Zurich offering a resilient network that is designed for strong connectivity. Qatar Airways has led the industry during these challenging times accumulating unrivalled experience in carrying passengers safely and reliably, especially in comparison to those airlines that have fully grounded their operations. The airline continues to provide an honest network that can be relied upon and trusted to operate. By maintaining a global network that never fell below 30 destinations, Qatar Airways has remained up to date with the latest in international airport procedures and implemented the most advanced safety and hygiene measures on board its aircraft and in Hamad International Airport (HIA), recently voted the Best Airport in the Middle East for the sixth year in a row. To ensure travellers can plan their travel with peace of mind, the airline has also extended its booking policies to offer even more choice to its passengers. The airline will allow unlimited date changes, and passengers can change their destination as often as they need if it is within 5,000 miles of the original destination. The airline will not charge any fare differences for travel completed before 31 December 2020, after which fare rules will apply. All tickets booked for travel up to 31 December 2020 will be valid for two years from the date of issuance. Passengers flying Business Class on Qsuite equipped aircraft can avail of the enhanced privacy this award-winning suite provides, including sliding privacy partitions and fully closing doors that create a private sanctuary. Passengers can also opt to use the 'Do Not Disturb (DND)' indicator in their private suite, if they wish to limit their interactions with the cabin crew. Qsuite continues to be available on flights to more than 30 destinations including London, Sydney, Singapore and Dallas Fort Worth with plans to add it to more routes throughout the summer. Qatar Airways has further enhanced its onboard safety measures for passengers and cabin crew. The airline has implemented several changes, including the introduction of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) suits for cabin crew while onboard, as well as a modified service that reduces interactions between the passengers and the crew inflight. Passengers will also be required to wear face coverings inflight, with the carrier recommending travellers bring their own for fit and comfort purposes. Hamad International Airport (HIA) has implemented stringent cleaning procedures and applied social distancing measures throughout its terminals. All passenger touchpoints are sanitized every 10-15 minutes and every boarding gate and bus gate counter is cleaned after each flight. In addition, hand sanitizers are provided at immigration and security screening points. HIA was recently ranked "Third Best Airport in the World", among 550 airports worldwide, by the SKYTRAX World Airport Awards 2020. HIA was also voted the 'Best Airport in the Middle East' for the sixth year in a row and 'Best Staff Service in the Middle East' for the fifth year in a row.

Prostate cancer is an important public health problem. It is an excellent candidate disease for chemo-prevention because prostate cancer is typically slow growing and is usually diagnosed in elderly males. Pygeum africanum (Prunus africana or Rosaceae) is an African prune (plum) tree found in tropical Africa. An extract from the bark of Pygeum africanum has been used in Europe as a prevention and treatment of prostate disorders including benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). More recently in the USA, the phytotherapeutic preparations of Pygeum africanum and Saw palmetto have been marketed for prostate health including prostate cancer prevention and treatment. The anti-cancer potential of Pygeum africanum has been tested both in vitro (PC-3 and LNCaP cells) and in␣vivo (TRAMP mouse model). In tissue culture, ethanolic extracts (30%) of Pygeum africanum inhibited the growth of PC-3 and LNCaP cells; induced apoptosis and altered cell kinetics; down regulated ERα and PKC-α protein, and demonstrated good binding ability to both mouse uterine estrogen receptors and LNCaP human androgen receptors. TRAMP mice fed Pygeum africanum showed a significant reduction (P = 0.034) in prostate cancer incidence (35%) compared to casein fed mice (62.5%). Pygeum africanum, which is widely used in Europe and USA for treatment of BPH, has a significant role in regulation of prostate cancer both in␣vitro and in␣vivo and therefore may be a useful supplement for people at high risk for developing prostate cancer. We would like to thank Dr. Wendy Applequest, Missouri Botanical Gardens for her kind assistance in obtaining the Pygeum africanum extract. We appreciate the help of Dr. George Rottinghaus, Department of Analytical chemistry, University of Missouri-Columbia in making the ethanol extract of Pygeum africanum. This work was supported by the Missouri University Center for Phytonutrient and Phytochemical Studies (MUCCPS), NIH Grant # P01-ES510535 and NIH grant # R01AT002978.
Armed Florida Homeowner Fights Off Invaders When an unknown woman rang the bell and knocked on the door of a Florida home, the homeowner decided not to answer, prompting the woman to drive away. But what was initially strange turned sinister when the woman immediately returned, aggressively knocking again. Then there was a sudden noise from the back of the house. That's when the homeowner grabbed his gun. Winter Garden police say the homeowner encountered a man wearing all black and a ski mask entering the house through a smashed patio door. The terrified homeowner acted instinctively and shot the intruder, who escaped and drove off with the woman. "He had a masked person at the back door … and then someone beating at the front door," police Lt. Scott Allen told WKMG News 6. "He was in fear for his life and thought that was his best option." A neighbor added, "The burglars probably thought no one was home, so that's kind of scary." Michael Bloomberg's The Trace Blames "Fake News" On NRA In a Dec. 12 post, The Trace blamed the rise of "fake news" on NRA. "Fake News" is the newest fad among those seeking to lay blame for Hillary Clinton's defeat on something other than Hillary. And The Trace blames NRA for using it to undermine trust in so-called "mainstream" media: "Rather than critically evaluating articles for their correspondence to known facts, the NRA has long encouraged its audience to dismiss these reports and the outlets that produce them as irredeemably opposed to a cherished way of life." NRA knows all about fake news. For decades, we've countered fake news from "trusted" sources with facts, debunking "Saturday Night Specials," "Cop-Killer Bullets" and "Assault Weapons." (The same sources told us, "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor" and, "Benghazi was caused by a video.") In fact, A1F deconstructed The Trace's own fake news in a 17-part series earlier this year. If The Trace wants to debunk fake news, it can start by explaining how lobbyists, labor unions and a synagogue wound up on a list of "141 medical groups" promoting gun control. Top Hoops Prospect Shuns "Dangerous" Hometown Of Chicago For Gun-Friendly Texas While gun-ban advocates would have you believe areas with more restrictive gun-control laws are safer than those that allow widespread gun ownership, a top college basketball recruit has chosen where to play based on facts to the contrary. According to a report at pilotonline.com, highly recruited point guard Evan Gilyard is shunning schools in his home city of Chicago, instead choosing the University of Texas-El Paso—located, incidentally, in one of the most gun-friendly areas in the country. "It's safer out there," Gilyard told pilotonline. "In Chicago you have a lot of violence, a lot of gang violence, and it hasn't been as safe. When I looked at UTEP, I saw there was a very small amount of murders." Gilyard makes a good point. This year, the Chicago homicide toll has already surpassed 700, and more than 4,000 people have been shot. And while some might say comparing the two communities is comparing apples to oranges, El Paso has a violent crime rate of 3.75 per 1,000 residents, while Chicago's is nearly three times higher, at 9.08 per 1,000 residents. Florida Will Again Consider Campus Carry In 2017 Following the ISIS-inspired attack on the campus of Ohio State University—a rampage that ended when a university police officer shot and killed the student—campus safety has again become part of the national discussion. And many are calling for new laws that will allow students with carry permits to legally carry a concealed firearm while on campus. Such is the case in Florida, where an NRA-backed proposal has been filed by Republican state Rep. Scott Plakon for the 2017 session. It will make the third year in a row that legislators have advocated for students being afforded the same right to protection on campus that they take advantage of while off campus. Should it fail to pass next year, proponents say it would endanger the state's 40 public college and university campuses by making them less safe. Many school police forces remain understaffed and, just last year, administrators unsuccessfully sought $74 million from the legislature to increase campus security operations. WA Bill Would Protect The Right To Carry At Sports Stadiums Should licensed, trained, background-checked, card-carrying Right-to-Carry permit holders be barred from entering sports stadiums while armed? Legislation now proposed in Washington state would prevent public stadiums or the private companies that operate them from barring armed Right-to-Carry permit holders from entering stadiums, but the NFL, The Washington Post and some at Fox News apparently think that's a bad idea. "We haven't seen the proposed legislation," said Brian McCarthy, the NFL's vice president of communications, "but we have a policy forbidding carrying a weapon into NFL stadiums." Former NFL player Jack Brewer pronounced it "a ridiculous law to even be proposing." And The Washington Post darkly warned that if the law passes, "guns could be added to an already combustible environment." Yet isn't that what critics said about the dozens of states that allow Right-to-Carry permit holders to be armed in establishments that serve alcohol? So ... where's the fire?

Now, we run all aspects of Milio's marketing, helping the brand drive sales through email marketing, digital advertising, content creation, and more. We've won six American Advertising Awards for the work we've done for Milio's.

The new site has seen a 7% lift in web sessions and a 15% lift in web sales per store. To complement the new site, we also implemented e-commerce tracking that allows Milio's to measure and analyze all web transactions, which helps guide their business decisions. Check out the new Milio's site here. Working with The Digital Ring has been beyond my expectations! I love that I have a whole team at TDR constantly ensuring my marketing is strategic and fresh. It adds so much to my business! In response to Milio's objectives, The Digital Ring helped create a two-part integrated social media campaign.

'Palestina' video 'PALESTINA' video 6:31min 2005 Palestina, is an Albanian girl. Her name may sound strange and unusual, but her name is Palestina. The name has been thrilling to her since she understood the real history of it. However, she feels proud of her name and the story of how she got that name. Palestina herself tells this history on video. Her mother, at the time when she was expecting a baby, was stunned by a tragedy taking place in Palestine. Israeli soldiers killed a young Palestinian in front of his girlfriend. Sad because of the cruel killing of her lover, young Palestinian girl, got into her car, filled it with explosives and clashed along with this car-bomb into an Israeli soldier convoy, killing as many as 20. The event took place in 1982, weeks before a Kosovo girl, later named after "Palestine", was born. Her mother, stunned with the tragic news comming from Palestine, decided immediately that if the baby she was going to give birth is a girl, she would be named Palestine. Her husband and the entire family were severely against this unusual name, but she was set and did not defer the pressure. On the video, Palestina herself tells how she understood the reality of her name's history: "Through this video I wanted to present the importance of interpretation and influence of the news upon global society, including news dealing with tragic and horrifying events that spark extreme reactions as even today it is not that easy to distinguish the boundary between heroism and madness". http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbdrIbZ_vLc 'Catch Me' 'Tibet' video
On the ship that downed a military drone, one small mistake could cause a war with Iran With short incendiary shrieks Harrier jump jets race across the USS Boxer's deck and are soon gray dots in the sky. Seahawk and Super Stallion helicopters leap and land like gigantic insects, feeding on the mother ship. The tilt-rotor Ospreys, part-plane part-helicopter, come and go while the others in their flock nest, folded in gray ranks, along the edges of the deck. It's a bestiary any ark would be proud of. But the USS Boxer has more than just aircraft with animal names. It has a crew of 1,000 plus some 1,500 US Marines on board. And enough armor, dune-buggies, artillery and even tanks to mount a small invasion. The hardware is stacked in hangars below decks. On Thursday, it was taking part in a tense but routine mission in the world's busiest shipping route as part of a three-ship expeditionary force through the Strait of Hormuz. Just hours after CNN left the ship, it downed what the US said was an Iranian drone that came too close, further escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran. A US Navy official said there were several other interactions between the US warship and Iranian military forces prior to the downing of the drone. This week's routine mission put the USS Boxer and its two accompanying vessels, the USS John P. Murtha and the USS Harpers Ferry, temporarily at the center of a potential storm as the US flexed the resources of the US Fifth Fleet at the US Naval Forces Central Command in Bahrain. If tensions boiled over, this fleet would be at the epicenter of a war that could, indeed would, spread through the entire Middle East. On board the USS Boxer, Marines train and maintain their equipment day and night alongside the crew. Many sleep in vast dormitories stacked six high in tiny bunks known as "coffin racks." Their only diversions are the gym and more training. The US military is proud of the Marines' wider doctrinal task to represent US national power overseas. In other words, it has to look impressive as it threads the needle of the Strait of Hormuz, letting Iran know just what the USS Boxer's group is designed for and capable of. The group's commodore, Captain Jason A. Burns, said this week's planned transit was an entirely routine enhancement to the US Fifth Fleet's long-standing role in the region. And indeed, Iranian sailors in this always tense neighborhood are used to seeing such vessels over the years. But the routine was first shattered in May, when four ships were mysteriously attacked by mines, which the US and UK have suggested came on Tehran's orders. In June, two more ships in the Gulf of Oman were also mined. Again, the US and the UK pointed their fingers at Iran. Since then every move, feint or mistake made by shipping in this region and beyond has been endowed with strategic meaning. On June 20, Iran shot down a US drone over the Strait. Iran said it had strayed into its airspace, the US said it was over international waters. President Donald Trump called off a retaliatory raid against Iranian air defenses at the last minute, he said, after deciding that an estimated death toll of around 150 Iranians was disproportionate. A few weeks later, a UK Navy frigate leveled its guns at Iranian gunboats that had attempted to maneuver a BP-owned oil tanker into Iranian waters. The encounter was seen as possible retaliation by Iran for the seizure of its own tanker, the Grace I, off the coast of Gibraltar. Grace 1 was suspected of smuggling 2 million barrels of Iraqi crude oil to Syria, in alleged violation of international embargoes on the Damascus regime. In both cases, escalation to a wider conflict was avoided. Thursday's drone downing was achieved using electronic jamming, according to a US defense official. The craft had come within 1,000 meters of the USS Boxer and ignored multiple calls to stand down, President Donald Trump said. Iran's Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters at the United Nations in New York Thursday that "we have no information about losing a drone." A return to worse days A return to the days when US and allied navies escorted ships through the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz to protect them against attempts by Iran to block Iraqi oil exports during the Iran-Iraq war, would be a dangerous escalation. The US Naval Forces Central Command and the Fifth Fleet were set up in Bahrain in 1995. They were designed to "command the afloat units that rotationally deploy or surge from the United States plus a few smaller ships that are based in the Gulf for longer periods," according to the US Department of Defense. The US Naval Forces Central Command is charged with managing the 33 nations who contribute ships to a coalition called the Combined Maritime Forces. This focuses on "defeating terrorism, preventing piracy, encouraging regional cooperation and promoting a safe maritime environment." The US is keen to put together a new "coalition" to ensure maritime security in the Gulf region against what Washington says are threats from Iran. But this coalition has proven harder to establish because many potential allies are so out of step with the US on Iran, and are keen to preserve the nuclear deal that Trump has torn up. A Spanish frigate, the ESPS Méndez Núñez, recently left the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, which is currently based in the Gulf of Oman and focuses on Iran. Spain does not support the US withdrawal from the anti-nuclear deal agreed with Iran in 2015. Neither does Britain. And while the UK is sending a destroyer to the region, it has not indicated whether it would join in an Iran-specific force — especially when a coalition force already exists and even has a Briton as its deputy commander. The consequences of a single mistake Amid the fissile atmosphere in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, a single mistake could unleash catastrophe. Earlier this week, Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, warned of the high stakes in play. "All through history Iran has provided security in these waters," he told CNN's Fareed Zakaria. "The United States is intervening in order to make these waters insecure for Iran. You cannot make these waters insecure for one country and secure for others." "Do you believe that as a result of this — whoever is to blame — you could have an escalation which would result in a military incident?" Zakaria asked him. "In such a small body of water if you have so many foreign vessels, I mean accidents will happen…" the Iranian foreign minister replied, emphasizing that Iran did not want war and called on all parties to "work" to avoid war. He drew attention to the US killing of 290 civilian passengers on board Iran Air flight 655, shot down by the USS Vincennes during the "tanker wars" of the 1980s. Tehran has repeatedly called for a return to negotiations with the US, but only if the US lifts economic sanctions first. This week there were signs that the Trump administration was preparing to make good on its offer to talk directly with Iran, without preconditions, reportedly tapping Senator Rand Paul as the man to make the overtures. On board the Boxer, CNN asked Brigadier General Trollinger, the commander of the Task Force controlling the USS Boxer, if an apparently minor misstep by a junior sailor or Marine could have dangerous consequences — like a war? "That's absolutely accurate," the general replied. "All the training we do, all the education we do is the express purpose of getting after that, to make sure that we eliminate or reduce rather… mitigate to the best of our ability … any risk of miscalculation." The alternative is almost unthinkable. But in complex negotiations, the trick is to convince the other that the unthinkable is an option.
The introduction of synthetic surfaces has significantly changed the sport of field hockey. Since being introduced in the 1970's , competitions in western countries are now mostly played on artificial surfaces. This has changed the game considerably with a fast pitch, true ball roll and player comfort with sport improving beyond recognition. Multisport Surfaces Ltd ensures that all synthetic hockey fields are installed to the highest standards. The quality of a hockey field is measured by its performance in the areas of safety, drainage and playing characteristics such as hockey ball behaviour. Multisport Surfaces Ltd provides a full hockey turf system, which includes construction and installation services through to project completion. There have since been significant improvements in modern hockey turf systems due to research of synthetic turf fibres and shock absorption properties. For new installations or an upgrade of your existing pitch, you can enjoy top flight hockey in the modern game with a Multisport Surfaces synthetic hockey field. This superior grade of hockey surface has a very high density of artificial grass with no sand infill thus providing a consistent ball roll and bounce. The surface is fully irrigated with a layer of water which results in an extremely fast and professional game. Due to the absence of sand, the blades of artificial grass are free-moving which enables players to get their hockey stick under the ball. This allows for a technical game with many possibilities. The grass fibres are kept upright by the sand infill, ensuring a high degree of stability and wear resistance. The surface provides an even and predictable ball roll. Sand filled hockey fields are very popular with schools and municipalities due to their multifunctional use. A dressed hockey field is one which has a partial sand infill between 66% to 80% of pile depth. This infill is enough to maintain the blades of artificial grass in a vertical position. The appearance resembles an unfilled hockey field but with a slightly longer pile height. A semi water based hockey field (sometimes called "half sand filled") is one which has a sand infill less than 60% of pile depth. The artificial grass surface is of a higher density than other sand based hockey fields. A built-in sprinkler system irrigates the field which provides a high quality surface similar to a water-based pitch.
the Red Tail Lodge of Mountain Creek Resorts in Vernon, NJ. Featuring live: From Good Homes!!!! Newton Medical Center has joined with several community partners to form Altitude…an empowerment program for 8th graders in Sussex County, inspiring students to "Take The Climb" toward their highest and best selves. Pass It Along is proud to be part of the Altitude Team. Through the multi-modal components of this program Altitude creates safe places and appropriate interventions to help students develop life skills, believe in their own strength and goodness and feel excited about using their time and talent in service to others. Taking place over the course of the entire 8th grade school year, students participate in workshops, school based clubs, school culture and climate assemblies, community service projects and more. An end of the school year Rally celebrates their success in Taking The Climb. We would like to invite you to join us as an Adult Participant at one or more of our our three upcoming Challenge Day events at Sparta Middle School, on Tuesday October 13, Wednesday October 14, and Thursday October 15. The program will run from 8:00am to 2:00pm each day. Challenge Days are powerful, high-­‐energy programs in which youth and adult participants are guided through a series of experiential learning processes. The overall goals of the program are to increase personal power and self-­‐esteem, to shift dangerous peer pressure to positive peer support and to eliminate the acceptability of teasing, violence and all forms of oppression. The Challenge Day Program is designed to unite the members of the school and to empower them to carry the themes of the program back to the school population. Challenge Day also successfully addresses issues of violence, teasing, social oppression, racism, harassment, conflict management, suicide, peer pressure, alcohol and drugs. Since 1987, the Challenge Day Program has touched the lives of over half-­‐a-­‐million teens and adults nationwide. The Challenge Day Program has received numerous awards from the juvenile justice system, government officials and many school districts and cities throughout the nation. The program was featured in the book Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul and the Emmy Award-­‐ winning documentary Teen Files: Surviving High School. Adult Participants are crucial for the success of the day. We will meet with all Adults for at 7:15am each day, prior to the start of the program, to let you know what is needed from you and to answer your questions. No prior training is necessary other than the morning check-­‐in meeting. Our Challenge Day staff closely monitors the program and our Leaders will give instructions throughout the day. You must be able to remain on site and participate fully for the entire program, including 30 minutes after the program at the end of the day for a post-­‐Challenge Day debriefing. Please email Tom Askin, Altitude Program Manager, to register: AltitudeNJ@gmail.com or call him directly at (973) 715-8124. We hope you will be able to join us for this wonderful experience!
Mystery Of The 80 Million-Year-Old Sharks' Teeth In The City Of David MessageToEagle | July 5, 2021 | Ancient World, Archaeology News | No Comments Conny Waters – MessageToEagle.com – A cache of fossilized shark teeth unearthed in a 2900-year-old site in the City of David in Jerusalem is an ancient puzzle to researchers. This find should not be found in this area. This is at least 80 km from where these fossils would be expected to be found. There is no conclusive proof of why the cache was assembled, but it may be that the 80 million-year-old teeth were part of a collection, dating from just after the death of King Solomon. Judean Hills. Image credit: David Shankbone – CC BY-SA 3.0 The same team has now unearthed similar unexplained finds in other parts of ancient Judea. "These fossils are not in their original setting, so they have been moved. They were probably valuable to someone; we just don't know why, or why similar items have been found in more than one place in Israel," Dr. Thomas Tuetken from the University of Mainz, Institute of Geosciences said. The teeth were found buried in the material used to fill in a basement before conversion to a large Iron-Age house. The house itself was situated in the City of David, one of the oldest parts of Jerusalem, found nowadays in the largely Palestinian village of Silwan. They were found together with fish bones thrown away as food waste 2900 years ago, and other infill material such as pottery. Intriguingly, they were found together with hundreds of bullae—items used to seal confidential letters and packages—implying a possible connection with the administrative or governing class at some point. Normally archaeological material is dated according to the circumstances where it is found, and so at first, it was assumed that the teeth were contemporary with the rest of the finds. Fossilised Squalicorax tooth Nr. #07815 from the Jerusalem site. Credit: Omri Lernau "We had at first assumed that the shark teeth were remains of the food dumped nearly 3000 years ago, but when we submitted a paper for publication, one of the reviewers pointed out that one of the teeth could only have come from a Late Cretaceous shark that had been extinct for at least 66 million years. That sent us back to the samples, where measuring organic matter, elemental composition, and the crystallinity of the teeth confirmed that indeed all shark teeth were fossils," Dr. Tuetken said. Their strontium isotope composition indicates an age of about 80 million years. This confirmed that all 29 shark teeth found in the City of David were Late Cretaceous fossils—contemporary with dinosaurs. More than that, they were not simply weathered out of the bedrock beneath the site, but were probably transported from afar, possibly from the Negev, at least 80 km away, where similar fossils are found". Since the first finds, the team has found other shark teeth fossils elsewhere in Israel, at the Maresha and Miqne sites. These teeth are also likely to have been unearthed and moved from their original sites. "Our working hypothesis is that the teeth were brought together by collectors, but we don't have anything to confirm that. There are no wear marks which might show that they were used as tools, and no drill holes to indicate that they may have been jewelry.," Dr. Tuetken said. "We know that there is a market for shark's teeth even today, so it may be that there was an Iron Age trend for collecting such items. This was a period of riches in the Judean Court. However, it's too easy to put 2 and 2 together to make 5. We'll probably never really be sure". Map of the main water bodies and potential fish habitats of Egypt and the Southern Levant: Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, upper Nile River, the brackish Lake Manzala on the Nile delta, the hypersaline Bardawil Lagoon in northern Sinai, and the freshwater Lake Kinneret and Jordan River, its main tributary, in northern Israel. Image source The shark teeth which have been identified come from several species, including from the extinct Late Cretaceous group Squalicorax. Squalicorax, which grew to between 2 and 5 meters long, lived only during the Late Cretaceous period (which was the same period as the late dinosaurs), so acts as a reference point in dating these fossils. "This research by Dr. Tuetken and colleagues is an excellent example of why it is so important to approach a research question with as few assumptions as possible, and how sometimes we have to revisit our initial assumptions. It also highlights how beneficial it can be to apply multiple tools to answer a research question. In this case, the authors used both strontium and oxygen isotopes, as well as X-ray diffraction and trace element analysis to establish the most likely age and origin of the fossil teeth," Dr. Brooke Crowley from the University of Cincinnati, commented. See also: More Archaeology News "It was a monumental work but these efforts have revealed a much more interesting story about the people who lived in this region in the past. I am very excited by this work and hope that one day, we might be able to unravel the mystery of why these fossil teeth are being recovered from cultural deposits".

Dental implants are a bespoke treatment used to replace missing teeth. A dental implant is made of titanium and is designed to replace the root of the tooth. Attached to this is a porcelain crown. Implants can be used to replace a single missing tooth or several missing teeth. It can even be used to support a full denture. Although they have a high success rate of more than 95%, correct treatment planning is crucial to ensuring long term success and stability of the implant supported prosthesis. Planning is complex and strong considerations are given to the amount of bone, quality of gums, oral hygiene and the occlusion (how your teeth bite together). A sound understanding of these aspects and more is what ensures optimal aesthetics are achieved. All these factors are considered when creating a quote for your dental implant cost. Payment plans are available to facilitate you receiving the treatment you desire. Dental implants have created a paradigm shift in dentistry and have fast become the high-end alternative to false teeth. The blending of science, biology and art to create incredibly beautiful, long-lasting aesthetic restorations. If you have missing teeth, click here to book a personal consultation with Dr Khan.
Dubai mall operator Majid Al Futtaim secures first $1.5bln sustainability-linked loan August 27, 2021 172 Loan agreement includes gender diversity target for women Dubai-based shopping mall operator Majid Al Futtaim (MAF) has secured its first sustainability-linked loan (SLL) of $1.5 billion dirhams. The five-year financing, which is structured as a revolving credit facility, is "the largest corporate, non-government-linked SLL in the region", the company said. It is also considered the largest in the real estate sector in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The facility is designed to link with the company's environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. The agreement includes a gender diversity target for women to constitute 30 percent of board members and senior management roles. "The signing of our first sustainability-linked loan comes as a result of, and in line with, our long-term strategic targets, including the production of more energy and water than we consume, reaching a net positive business model by 2040," said Ziad Chalhoub, chief financial officer of Majid Al Futtaim Holding. As part of the SLL, Majid Al Futtaim plans to have all its malls certified LEED Gold or better. A LEED certification provides independent verification of a building or neighborhood's green features. In its latest sustainability report published in June, the company said it has achieved 97 percent of the targets set out in its annual sustainability strategy last year, despite the business and economic disruption brought about by the pandemic.

Movie & TV Reviews Letters to the Editor + Op-Eds Women's Basketball: No. 5 Huskies survive slugfest against Providence behind Juhasz's double-double 'Gunther's Millions' is not the canine cashflow story we deserve State News: $45 Million tax cut for low income workers; CT lawmakers take initiatives to decrease domestic violence; 100,000 chickens die in fire The Daily CampusThe Daily Campus Home Editorial Editorial: UConn Athletics should no longer sport such a nasty deficit Editorial: UConn Athletics should no longer sport such a nasty deficit The Daily Campus Relative Change in AD Subsidy and key Budget Components normalized to 2005 level. Graph courtesy of the University Senate Budget Committee The University of Connecticut prides itself on its athletics, especially its illustrious women's and men's basketball teams. The UConn community clamors for victories related not only to game outcomes but also to financial gain. Unfortunately UConn's athletics budget deficit skyrocketed to $42.3 million – one of the highest values nationwide – in 2019. Although several extenuating circumstances factored into this absurd deficit – and might lead to another one in FY20 – it'd be inexcusable for UConn Athletics to continue sporting such a nasty deficit. An exponential rise in annual operating expenses looms large. A 2017 University Budget Committee report noted that "between 2005 and 2017, expenditures for the AD grew 70% from $47 million to $80 million." This falls in line with 2019's total of $79,070,708 in operating expenses, which is due to increase by approximately $1 million in 2020, according to the University Senate. Such circumstances have forced UConn to provide a greater subsidy to its athletics department, contributing nearly $36 million in 2019. While said university subsidy – in conjunction with student fees – has offset the deficit somewhat, it isn't a sustainable solution to UConn Athletics' budgetary issues. Many factors can be attributed to this predicament. Chief among them is UConn's affiliation with the American Athletic Conference (AAC), which has reduced TV revenue and increased recruiting, travel and game expenses significantly. UConn's recently fired coaches, particularly those of its football and men's basketball teams, have exacerbated the university's athletics budget woes via severance packages and an arbitration case, respectively. Ticket sales have also been dropping, although this appears to be an issue for college sports nationwide. Despite such setbacks, UConn Athletics has great potential to avoid trouble moving forward. For one, UConn hopes to reduce its AD subsidy, which is one of the highest among NCAA-eligible institutions, within the next few years. The university's return to the Big East, which'll incur additional short-term expenses, should attract more TV revenue and alleviate operating expenditures. And barring unforeseen circumstances, UConn shouldn't have to buy out any more high-profile coaches within the near future. According to a university statement, "Athletics-related donations increased 42% between FY18 and FY19 (from $10.4 million to $14.4 million) … While FY 20 projections point to athletics requiring a similar amount of University support, we project that athletics revenue will increase and we will be in a much improved situation financially in FY 21." Before long, UConn Athletics should stop dropping the ball and get it rolling in money once again.

Angela Grant Plant-Based Ethnopharmacological Remedies for Hypertension in Suriname By Dennis R.A. Mans, Angela Grant and Nicholaas Pinas Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal diseases which are together among the most frequent causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Despite the availability of a wide range of effective medicines, many individuals suffering from hypertension use plant-derived preparations for treating their disease. The choice for these alternatives is often associated with the closer relationship of such approaches to specific social, cultural, and religious perceptions about health and disease. However, in most cases, the scientific evidence for clinical efficacy of such medications is scant. The Republic of Suriname is a middle-income country in South America with a relatively high prevalence of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. This country harbors descendants of all continents, all of whom have preserved their cultural customs including their ethnopharmacological traditions. As a result, many Surinamese are inclined to treat their diseases including hypertension as they have done for centuries, that is, with plant-based preparations. This chapter has compiled the plants used for treating hypertension in Suriname; extensively evaluates 15 commonly used plants for potential efficacy on the basis of available phytochemical, mechanistic, preclinical, and clinical literature data; and closes with conclusions about their potential usefulness against the disease.

'Thirsty' for More B-52 pilot logs historic 10,000 flying hours in B-52 Bomber March 16, 2017 in Defense When he first began his U.S. Air Force career, Lt. Col. Steven R. "Thirsty" Smith never expected to be flying the Boeing B-52 Bomber, let alone flying it for 30 years. Yet on March 3, 2017, he exceeded more than 10,000 flight hours in the iconic bomber, more than any other aviator currently serving in the Air Force. In fact, it's a milestone that has not been accomplished since the Vietnam era. With 496 combat hours beginning during Operation Desert Storm, Lt. Col. Smith describes the B-52 as a solid jet he will enjoy flying for several more years. Now an instructor with the 93rd Bomb Squadron, he's training the next generation who will fly the aircraft into the future. Because the United States Air Force and Boeing are partnering to modernize and transform the B-52 for today's flight, the aircraft, with accomplished pilots like Thirsty Smith at the controls, will continue to serve as the backbone of the nuclear and conventional bomber force for many years to come, to 2050 and beyond. Lt. Col. Steven Smith has been in the Air Force for 30 years. He recently celebrated his 10,000th flight hour in the B-52 at Barksdale Air Force Base, in Louisiana.

You see, neither of us are very big pork fans, so last summer we thought we'd cheat a little and use chicken instead. They turned out to be delicious, so we thought "who needs pork anyways, when you can just make these?" But after that meal the idea of making real pulled pork started marinating (pun intended) in our minds. Fast-forward several months to our family raving about this Memphis Barbecue place and the whole idea was brought back to us again. The only problem was that since our family doesn't really eat a whole lot of pork, we never really it in our freezer. But when we arrived home from school for the summer and found a giant pork rib roast sitting in the bottom of our big freezer, it was like a sign from the universe! And you know what? We're pretty certain that if pork always tasted like this, we would have no problem eating it on a regular basis, because it was a-maz-ing! So there you have it, folks! A pulled-pork feast for a crowd! Great for a Sunday dinner, but if you make the coleslaw and corn bread in advance, you could even have this on the table in 20 minutes for an easy weeknight meal, too! Trim most of the excess fat off the roast (if you can't get it all off don't worry, a little is ok). Place the pork into the bottom of the slow cooker and sprinkle the onion over top. In a separate dish, combine all of the sauce ingredients and pour over top of the pork and onions. Cook on high for 6-8 hours, until the pork tears easily with a fork. When the pork is done, remove it from the slow-cooker and shred with two forks. Return the meat to the pot and stir so that the sauce is evenly coating all of the pork. Turn the pot to low or the "keep-warm" setting if you have one, and allow to sit with the lid on until you are ready to serve. Do you like pork? Have you ever had pulled pork before or tried to make it yourself?

She always loved history and "as an adult I wanted to figure out what was going on over there. It was so hard balancing what I read in the news with what I read in the Bible.? While searching for the truth, Robin discovered a love for the people of Israel. "I see prophecy being fulfilled and my heart is tender for the people who came back to their land.? When this soft-spoken Southerner starts talking about Israel, there is fire in her speech and passion in her voice. Back in 2009, Robin's good friend, Jan Shaddox, introduced her to Sondra Baras. After hearing Sondra speak at an event in Minneapolis, Robin realized that CFOIC Heartland was exactly the kind of organization she wanted to support. She consulted with Kim Troup, Director of CFOIC's American office, and together they decided on just the right project: a traditional Shabbat dinner for Christians. Robin enlisted Dr. Steve and Jan Shaddox and David and Cathy Evans and together they launched the project.Robin had a dream… a picture in her head, and by paying attention to every detail, she made this event glorious. She needed a space that would accommodate a crowd. "I trusted in the Lord that people would want to come. Christians are becoming more and more interested in Israel, in figuring out the truth, in putting pieces together.? Naturally, the color scheme was Israeli, with blue and white tablecloths. Robin thought of the perfect centerpiece, though it wasn't easy finding a source for flowering olive branches in the middle of May in Arkansas! The florist promised her that if necessary, she would personally glue on the olives! "It was very important to me for my guests to see the people of the Biblical Heartland, to feel daily life in the communities.? So Kim Troup sent her pictures and Robin laminated and hung photos from the branches, of the people of Judea and Samaria. Robin insisted on round tables and family style service instead of a buffet. "Passing dishes from hand to hand is more in keeping with the feeling of a Shabbat meal in a home.? The menu for the evening started with the traditional braided Challah loaves. "The bread wasn't kosher, but it was Challah!? For dessert, Robin commissioned individual cakes for each table, frosted white, topped with blue-icing Stars of David. One hundred eighty people showed up to the Fellowship Bible Church on May 18th, 2011. Kim Troup introduced CFOIC Heartland and then Sondra Baras and Rabbi Naphtali Weisz from Columbus, Ohio presided. They walked everyone through the Shabbat meal, explaining the rituals, the blessings, the songs. Sondra then gave an in-depth analysis of current events in the Middle East and opened the floor to questions. All proceeds of the evening went to benefit Jewish communities of CFOIC Heartland. Robin modestly explains: "Sometimes it's hard to think that one homemaker can do much. But G-d does things to people's hearts. If I was a Jew in Israel it would comfort me to know that I was loved and that people were praying for me. I never want the people of Israel to feel alone." Robin enjoys going to CUFI, where she listens to speakers on Middle East issues. While there, she takes the opportunity to visit with her congressmen, who are pro Israel. "Let them see our faces; let them know we appreciate what they are doing. It's a pity, because sometimes negative is louder than positive and I long for a turnaround." Robin and her husband Gary have four grown children and six grandchildren, all of whom live nearby. "I am blessed," says Robin. Robin, we too are blesse © 2017 All rights reserved. Christian Friends of Israeli Communities About CFOIC Heartland Christian Friends of Israeli Communities was established in 1995, in response to the Oslo Process, which ceded land to the Palestinian Authority in the heart of Biblical Israel. CFOIC Heartland stands steadfastly with Jews who are at greatest risk in Israel by connecting them with Christians around the world who share their core Biblical values.

Q: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined on useState value I'm new to react, I'm getting this error constantly and after google some I can't find the reason why the useState value can't be read as array :( ... this the error I'm getting: 'TypeError: team.map is not a function' import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react"; const SportTeams = () => { const [team, setTeam] = useState([]); useEffect(() => { const getSports = async () => { const response = await fetch("https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/1/all_sports.php"); const data = await response.json(); setTeam(data); console.log(data); } getSports(); }, []); return ( <div className="myClass"> <ul> {team.map((sport, index) => { return <li key={`${sport.strSport}-${index}`}>{sport.strSport}</li> })} </ul> </div> ); }; export default SportTeams; A: Just update setTeam like following, your error will be resolved. setTeam(data.sports); A: It is because you are setting the team state with the data without checking if its undefined. If the data is undefined your state team become undefined as well. So make sure to check the data. import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react"; const SportTeams = () => { const [team, setTeam] = useState([]); useEffect(() => { const getSports = async () => { const response = await fetch("https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/1/all_sports.php"); if (response) { const data = await response.json(); if (data) { setTeam(data); } } console.log(data); } getSports(); }, []); return ( <div className="myClass"> <ul> {team.map((sport, index) => { return <li key={`${sport.strSport}-${index}`}>{sport.strSport}</li> })} </ul> </div> ); }; export default SportTeams; There might also be the chance that your response is not what you expected and the actual data might be inside your response. In that case you need check what your response first then proceed to set the data. A: As I said in my comment. the value you are setting to teams isn't an array. const data = await response.json(); setTeam(data.sports);
You are here: Home / Profiles / Interviews / A Mix of Sarah Bareilles Meets Adele: Interview with Up-and-Coming Singer Samantha Aurelio A Mix of Sarah Bareilles Meets Adele: Interview with Up-and-Coming Singer Samantha Aurelio February 6, 2013 Collaj Filed under Profiles / Interviews By Amanda Deltuvia — Hailing from the East Coast, Grammy nominated singer Samantha Aurelio is petite but she can hit those notes with strength and prowess. With a Sarah Bareilles-infused piano style synced with a voice comparable to Adele's amazing pipes, it's clear that Aurelio is a tour de force. Samantha Aurelio received a Grammy nomination for her work with the well-known jazz organist Joey DeFrancesco on his album "Never Can Say Goodbye" in 2011, and has been on the move ever since. The 5-foot-tall performer has been actively singing and performing for the last eight years. Recently, she released her first self-titled EP with producer Joe Buscema and is gaining fans from coast-to-coast. Here is Aurelio in her own words. AD: You just released an EP. Which is your favorite track on it and why? SA: My favorite track is "Fly Away," because I didn't trust that song when I first wrote it. So the creation of that song means a little more by seeing the transformation process. I'd like to call it "The Little Song that Could." AD: What're your top three favorite songs of all time? SA: I'd probably have to go with "Don't Stop Me Now," by Queen. That's a really hard question, I like the craziest music. Let's see, "Fire and Rain" by James Taylor. "Blackbird" by The Beatles. Those are definitely top three. Little eclectic, old school. Newer stuff would be "Let the Rain" by Sarah Bareilles. AD: Are there any new artists that people may not know about that have tickled your fancy lately? SA: I am on a huge Ellie Goulding kick lately. I'm going to see her when I go out to L.A. And Allen Stone. AD: Speaking of L.A., when are you going? SA: February 6th. AD: Where will you be playing? SA: I am playing Feb 11th, which is a Monday, at 8pm at Room 5 in West Hollywood. And I believe that there is a "Songwriter's Night" after my set. It's my set, then open mic after. If you go to my Facebook page, you can pull up the address. AD: What are your favorite things about L.A. and Hollywood? SA: Besides the weather? I love the life of it. The dream of it all. It's like the "Goldenland." It's a little more packaged than New York is. New York is the promised struggle, and L.A. is all wrapped in gold, always sunny, a little bit happier. AD: What are some of your favorite spots in the L.A. area? SA: I'm pretty fond of the Starbucks in LAX. I go there every time I fly (laughs). I have to stop at the beach every time I go out to the West Coast, either Santa Monica Pier or Manhattan Beach. Frida Mexican Cuisine I believe is the restaurant I went out to before the Grammys. I also love Malibu Seafood and Health Nut. AD: What is an interesting fact about you that not many people would know? SA: Hmm… I really love Olympic lifting and gymnastics. I've been doing Crossfit for about four years and before that I was a runner and did karate. Basically, my mom wanted me to be really tough for my size! AD: Do you have a favorite quote? SA: "I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for." I feel like John Mayer wrote that about me. AD: Top three passions in life? SA: Music, writing and cooking. I love cooking. AD: You always have a slew of love songs and breakup songs, are these solely based off of your experiences or have you pulled interesting relationship stories from friends into your music? SA: The stuff that I released is all personal. I have stuff that I have not released, that is in the making that is of other peoples' relationships. AD: Do you find it easier to write about your own relationship experiences or other peoples'? SA: Me. 100%. Samantha Aurelio with her band crew Well, it depends on where I start. Because sometimes I start at the piano and sometimes I start with the words. Lately, I'd say I end up in a coffee shop for a couple of hours and write a whole lot. Sometimes you'll catch me singing quietly into my phone recording melodies and then, coming back later to my piano and work from there. Usually it involves a lot of writing before I do any musical accompaniment. Lots of time in the coffee shop. (laughs) They know me there, it's cool. AD: When you get stumped on music or lyrics, what do you do to get inspired? SA: Spotify everything. AD: Spotify? SA: Because there's so much music there! Usually where I hear the melody in my head, is usually the genre of music I start to listen to. Because if I try to write an upbeat song, I'm not gonna listen to a ton of really slow stuff. (laughs). In a perfect world I'd like to go see a show whenever I'm stuck. That's really inspiring. Every time I leave a show, I'm like "I wanna write an album!" AD: What's the next step? Are you going to record an album? SA: We are writing the album. That's what's happening. My producer and I are going to co-write and produce a full-length masterpiece. It's very exciting. We're in the writing process now, so it's just a little baby. We have to nurture it and let it grow. Just like a seed.

So i have changed my "open Dataset " to OPEN DATASET lv_path FOR OUTPUT IN LEGACY TEXT MODE CODE PAGE 8404. As Code page of Chinese is 8404. Still i could not see the correct text of chinese even after this change. Please guide me where iam wrong. do you still get hashes (#) in this case (legacy mode) ?

Almost right on queue, as soon as a proposal for a new bike trail is on the table, disclaimers immediately follow. This particular network of trails was jointly announced with the disappointment that the trail couldn't be built to full width. The greenway is proposed to be a 10- to 12-foot-wide, ADA-accessible trail, though this may not be feasible in some sections of the corridor due to environmental, right-of-way, and topographical constraints. This needs to stop. I'm all for protecting sensitive lands and being as environmentally friendly as possible, and we all understand that building through such areas come at a cost. But we also build six lane super-highways above & through environmentally sensitive areas, so we should be able to build a simple 12 foot wide path that would ultimately be more useful than the six lane highway 25 years from now. I'm thinking about the ICC where the bike lane was promised for the full length of the toll road, but remains unbuilt on account that it would cause too much environmental damage. We need to look at the big picture and stop cutting these really small corners. If the ICC right-of-way, for example, was such an environmentally sensitive area, perhaps they should have only built four lanes and allowed for the bike lanes, saving more than 24 feet of roadway instead of just 12 feet of bike trail. The above quote is from the "concept" plans for the Patapsco Regional Greenway. Concept, to me, means it should be time to dream and plan what the network should be like, without restrictions and short changing bicyclists. Bike and pedestrian networks should be planned and implemented with the same priorities as large roadway projects, including public input that would have a process of vetting the concept ideas and selecting the most sensible. All of this needs to be supported with investment to make the project a success. This is no time for dismissing and skimping on trail design. Make a concept that would serve the needs today and 25 years from now.
The Gutenberg Cave is regarded as one of the most beautiful dripstone caves in the Swabian Alb. Just like the Gußmann Cave nearby, this is also a fissure cave, although it is located in the higher transitional level between bedded limestones and massive limestones of the Lower Chalk formation. There are six fairly large chambers in the cave which are connected to one another by narrow, high passageways. There is a remarkable collection of stalactites, stalagmites and sinter deposits, particularly at the back of the cave. May to October: Sat von 1 p.m. - 5 p.m., Sun and public holidays 10 a.m. - 5 p.m. The Gutenberger cave is a geopoint since September 2016.
Hospitals that are aiming at improving their postoperative pain therapy and that are honestly interested in evaluating their own patients' outcome compared to national averages are our project's target group. As QUIPS includes all patients who have undergone surgery (and not only those who are cared for by acute pain units or who are equipped with PCA-pumps), the hospitals' persons in charge of the project should not be members of the particular departments (e.g. anesthesiology, surgery, nursing) but build a team out of all clinical partners who are involved in postoperative patient care (for example, an interdisciplinary task force 'acute pain' could be established). From experience we know that the best way to start QUIPS is to choose two or three surgical departments with no more than 5 - 6 wards at the beginning.

Q: How to use listing, tikz and tikzmark packages together to annotate source code listing? I'd like to annotate code listing something like this: Below is what I've attempted so far. I am a little worried about having to use raisebox so that the arrow tip doesn't point to the base of the line. How can I avoid this hardcoding? I would also appreciate any advice on improvements so that it's easier to handle a few varieties of annotations as seen in the screenshot. It would be nice, to get the desired results, if I can just specify the following: * *the distance between the end of source line and the arrow tip *the length of the horizontal line and the length of the vertical line of the arrow (and whether the vertical line goes upwards or downwards) *and the position of the text node (whether right or left of the vertical line and vertical alignment of text node with the top or bottom. \documentclass[twoside, openright, 10pt]{book} \usepackage{listings} \usepackage{tikz} \usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta, tikzmark} \begin{document} \chapter{TiKz} \begin{lstlisting}[caption={[MeetKarel]{MeetKarel}}, label={lst:meet_karel}, escapechar=ß] import stanford.karel.Karel; public class MeetKarel extends Karel { public void run() { move(); move(); move(); ß\tikzmark{b}ßpickBeeper();ß\raisebox{2.6pt}{\tikzmark{a}}ß turnLeft(); move(); move(); turnLeft(); turnLeft(); turnLeft();ß\raisebox{2.6pt}{\tikzmark{c}}ß move(); putBeeper(); move(); } } \end{lstlisting} \begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay] \draw([shift={(12ex,10ex)}] pic cs:a) ++ (0.05, 0) % shift just a little to the right % set inner and outer to 0 so that text is alighed with the beginning of the vertical line node[inner sep=0,outer sep=0, fill=yellow!80!black,text width=5cm, anchor= north west] {Shifted a little above so that the arrow head points to the middle of the line.}; \draw[thin, gray, arrows = {-Stealth[inset=0pt, angle=45:7pt]}] ([shift={(12ex,10ex)}] pic cs:a) -- ([shift={(12ex,0ex)}] pic cs:a) -- ([shift={(0ex,0ex)}] pic cs:a); \draw([shift={(12ex,-10ex)}] pic cs:c) ++ (0.05, -0.05) % shift just a little to the right and down % set inner and outer to 0 so that text is alighed with the beginning of the vertical line node[inner sep=0,outer sep=0, fill=yellow!80!black,text width=5cm, anchor= south west] {I want to align base line of this text to the `c` node nicely. }; \draw[thin, gray, arrows = {-Stealth[inset=0pt, angle=45:7pt]}] ([shift={(12ex,-10ex)}] pic cs:c) -- ([shift={(12ex,0ex)}] pic cs:c) -- ([shift={(0ex,0ex)}] pic cs:c); \end{tikzpicture} \end{document} Result: A: Here's a slightly simplified version of your code. * *By using the tikzmark special listings library then you don't need to specify tikzmarks in your code, they are all provided for you. *The arrows start at (0.5,.5ex) away from the corresponding tikzmarks. The .5ex is half the height of an x, and looks a good vertical height to me. *The lines and nodes are drawn together and the -| path construction is used to make the line bend nicely. *A little bit is added to the outer xsep of the label nodes to move them away from the joining line. Other ways of achieving the same effect do seem to cause issues with the arrow placement. All of this contrives to make the code much shorter. Various numbers could be hard-coded into a style to make it even more simple and a bit more flexible. \documentclass[twoside, openright, 10pt]{book} %\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/657375/86} \usepackage{listings} \usepackage{tikz} \usetikzlibrary{ arrows.meta, tikzmark, calc, positioning } \usetikzmarklibrary{listings} \begin{document} \chapter{Ti\emph{k}Z} \begin{lstlisting}[ caption={[MeetKarel]{MeetKarel}}, label={lst:meet_karel}, name=karel, escapechar=ß ] import stanford.karel.Karel; public class MeetKarel extends Karel { public void run() { move(); move(); move(); pickBeeper(); turnLeft(); move(); move(); turnLeft(); turnLeft(); turnLeft(); move(); putBeeper(); move(); } } \end{lstlisting} \begin{tikzpicture}[ remember picture, overlay, annotation/.style={ inner sep=0pt, outer sep=0pt, outer xsep=1mm, fill=yellow!80!black, text width=5cm }, >={Stealth[inset=0pt, angle=45:7pt]} ] \draw[<-] (pic cs:line-karel-7-end) ++(.5,.5ex) -| ++(2,1.5) node[annotation, below right] {Shifted a little above so that the arrow head points to the middle of the line.}; \draw[<-] (pic cs:line-karel-13-end) ++(0.5,.5ex) -| ++(2,-1) node[annotation, above right] {I want to align base line of this text to the `c` node nicely. }; \end{tikzpicture} \end{document}

This isn't a recipe post, but it's still a great one because trust me when I say you'll want this cleanser in your life! Today, I bring you my review of the Algenist Anti-Aging Melting Cleanser: This is an oldie but a goodie! I used this cleanser for a few months last year & re-incorporated it into my morning routine a little over a month ago & I" mso happy that I did! For me, this product is a "kill two birds with one stone" sitch. Not only does it leave my skin smooth & soft immediately after I use it, but overtime, I've seen an improvement in the clarity & brightness of my skin. It's specifically designed to non-drying (unlike a lot of other cleansers, which are full of soapy ingredients that actually dry out the skin). It's made with alguronic acid, micro algae oil (so you get the benefits of an oil cleanser: washes away impurities but leaves behind the skin's natural oils so it won't strip your skin of moisture), It also has tons of nourishing anti-inflammatory, skin-glowing & healing fatty acids from oils, such as sweet alone, chlorella, avocado, bilberry & olive oil (the oleic acid in olive oil is amazing for preventing moisture loss also). What sold me on this cleanser initially was the texture. It starts off as a gel, turns into a silky lightweight oil & when you add warm water, it turns into a milky formula & leaves my skin feeling refreshed, clean & smooth. PSA: It contains no parabens or sulphates, it's soap-free, non comedogenic, hypoallergenic & dermatologist tested. I highly recommend picking it up if some of the things I mentioned are what you're looking to accomplish with your cleanser! I personally like it in the morning & I oil cleanse at night. You can get it at Sephora! 🙂 Thank me later! Let's Get Personal: My Shower Care Routine a.k.a. Keepin' It PG!
Q: How to get number of matching colums count in the same table as another column? I have a table like below. +----+----------+---------+--------+----------+---------+---------------------+ | id | box_name | diIndex | diMode | diStatus | status | last_updated | +----+----------+---------+--------+----------+---------+---------------------+ | 7 | boxa | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2017-03-02 10:49:35 | | 8 | boxa | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2017-03-02 10:49:35 | | 9 | boxa | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2017-03-02 10:49:36 | | 10 | boxa | 3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2017-03-02 10:49:36 | | 11 | boxa | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2017-03-02 10:49:36 | | 12 | boxa | 5 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2017-03-02 10:49:36 | | 13 | boxa | 6 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2017-03-02 10:49:36 | | 14 | boxa | 7 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 2017-03-02 10:49:36 | +----+----------+---------+--------+----------+---------+---------------------+ Now I want to add a new column in the table which will get me the total number of each matching record of status column like below. +----+----------+---------+--------+----------+---------+---------------+---------------------+ | id | box_name | diIndex | diMode | diStatus | status | status count | last_updated | +----+----------+---------+--------+----------+---------+---------------+---------------------+ | 7 | boxa | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 2017-03-02 10:49:35 | | 8 | boxa | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 2017-03-02 10:49:35 | | 9 | boxa | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 2017-03-02 10:49:36 | | 10 | boxa | 3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 2017-03-02 10:49:36 | | 11 | boxa | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2017-03-02 10:49:36 | | 12 | boxa | 5 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 2017-03-02 10:49:36 | | 13 | boxa | 6 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 2017-03-02 10:49:36 | | 14 | boxa | 7 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 2017-03-02 10:49:36 | +----+----------+---------+--------+----------+---------++--------------+---------------------+ Here you can see that for status value 1 there are 3 records so value for status_count for columns having status as 1 will be 3 and so on.. How can I achieve this? A: With window functions, this would be almost trivial to add as a column in a query: COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY status) AS status_count Since MySQL hasn't implemented them (you'll have to wait, they may be in the next version), you'll need something more complex now. It can be done with a derived table - to calculate these counts - and then join to the base table: SELECT t.id, t.box_name, t.diIndex, t.diMode, t.diStatus, t.status, g.status_count, t.last_updated FROM tableX AS t JOIN ( SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS status_count FROM tableX GROUP BY status ) AS g ON t.status = g.status ;

Q: How to reset all components in Vue.js I'm trying to restart my component when the route changes: beforeRouteUpdate (to, from, next) { Object.assign(this.$data, this.$options.data()) console.log(to.query); next(); } but it doesn't work; it only prints the console.log. I've also tried this.$options.data.call(this) and apply. A: In order to force Vue to re-render same component upon route query change, it is possible to assign a key to the <router-view it mount's into and push router to the page with the same route name or path. Example: Mounting point: <router-view :key="$route.fullPath" /> Component navigation, assuming route name is blog <router-link :to={ name: 'blog', query: { count: 10 } }>Link to the same route</router-link> This is assuming that you want to reset data of page component while navigating to the same page component with different data. If component that you want to reset is not the route component, it is possible to reset it's data with watch option, while saving original data. Example: data () { return { initialData: { // some initial data }, data: {} } }, watch: { '$route.fullPath': { immediate: true, // Immediate option to call watch handler on first mount handler () { this.resetData() } } }, methods: { resetData () { this.data = Object.assign({}, this.initialData) }, }, Note, that any $route options can be watched and additional conditions added to handler via next and previous arguments.

"Working with ANDP we know one thing for sure - get the project right and we will be taken care of. This trust is crucial in the residential construction business. The more trust we have in a relationship, the more efficient we work." - Van Hardimon, Van Hardimon Construction, ANDP Single-Family development partner Addressing Atlanta's Equity Crisis: Building Wealth & Economic Opportunity Why it Matters: Read why ANDP works to create economic opportunities for small, locally owned Black businesses in the affordable housing sector. Learn More. THE PROBLEM: Atlanta ranks first in economic inequality and nearly last in upward mobility in America. The typical Black household currently has less than a quarter (23.3%) of the wealth of a typical white household, down from more than a third (34.6%) before the Great Recession. Almost 40% (38.4%, or $1.18 trillion) of the $3 trillion wealth gap is attributable to homeownership rates and home values. WHY IT MATTERS: Centuries of systemic racism in America's homeownership delivery system, including the development of our modern mortgage finance system, have led to deep racial disparities in homeownership rates, economic opportunity, and historical gaps in wealth. Black and minority families are disproportionately affected by the affordable housing shortage due to a history of institutionalized racism. From unequal access to funds for Black veterans under the G.I. bill to decades of redlining and unfair lending practices, it is difficult to find a more systemic form of racism than in the housing sector. Despite efforts to outlaw housing discrimination, a vast divide remains between the rate of white homeownership (75%) and the rate of Black homeownership (44%). This homeownership gap is a leading source of the wealth gap. Nationwide, Black-owned homes are typically worth about 18% less than white-owned homes. If the typical Black-owned home were worth the same as the typical white-owned home, Black wealth would more than double (from $930 billion to $2.1 trillion). Research by the Brookings Institution finds, "Most people start their firms using their personal wealth – most often, the equity in their home." This direct link between homeownership rates, home values, and economic opportunities for Black families demonstrates the importance of investing in affordable homeownership and Black-owned businesses engaged in affordable housing - contractors, construction partners, property managers, and more. SOLUTIONS: To create economic opportunity and equity in the marketplace while building critically needed housing supply to bridge metro Atlanta's homeownership and wealth gaps, ANDP is investing $50M in Black-owned small businesses. ANDP's vision for racial equity motivates and informs every phase of its work: in its development, policy, and lending capacities; the geographic focus of neighborhoods served; the selection of contractors and partners; and the makeup of its staff and Board of Directors. Through its campaign to create and preserve 2,000 units of affordable housing by 2025, ANDP estimates it will be able to invest more than $50 million into Black-owned residential contractors, subcontractors, and vendors in the form of partnership investments, direct contracts, and low-cost loans. OUR IMPACTWith an intentional focus on working with locally-based, Black-owned businesses, ANDP has grown its scale in producing homeownership opportunities while growing Black-owned companies in the process. Prioritizing Black-owned businesses - ANDP's work is having a lasting impact on the capacity and longevity of locally-based, Black-owned businesses. Through partnership investments, direct contracts, and low-cost loans, ANDP is investing tens of millions in local businesses. Currently, 50% of ANDP's contractors and construction partners are Black-owned. Developing 100 homes annually - In the last five years, ANDP has doubled its production to 100 homes annually. Since 2009, we have developed 700+ single-family homes, creating much-needed homeownership and single-family rental options. Building Small Business Scale - Since partnering with ANDP, two developers have been able to add staff and significantly expand their company; another has reported a 35% increase in revenue. Increasing down payment assistance - Rising rents and stagnant wages make saving for a down payment on a home a challenge. ANDP has deployed DPA to nearly 1,000 homebuyers in the last decade. Building Black wealth through homeownership - A study of ANDP homebuyers, 76% of whom are from households of color, demonstrates a five-year wealth gain of nearly $89,000 in homeowner equity. Approximately 93% of ANDP homebuyers are still in their homes. This longevity comes with a host of benefits to the family and the greater community, including increased civic participation, better educational outcomes for children, better health outcomes tied to quality housing conditions, and generational wealth.

The most appreciatable component about Sano Sansar is its visualisation and cinematography. Kathmandu looks beautiful from Alok's camera, and he has successfully shown us the beauty that lies in the places we always see. St. Xaviers never looked like this before. I think we all must go to the theater and watch this movie, so that better Nepali movies come up. We really need to appreciate this gem in between the potatoes :P.

Tag Archives: Marian Hossa Brooks: Pronger deal cleared by NHL According to Larry Brooks of the NY Post, the NHL has issued an ultimatum of sorts to the NHLPA, demanding compliance with a new set of rules concerning high-end, salary cap circumventing contracts or else face the editing of current rule-bending contracts. Either way, it looks like Chris Pronger's deal with the Flyers is safe. After specifically calling out the contracts of Roberto Luongo, Marian Hossa, Ilya Kovalchuk and possibly Mark Savard, it was mentioned that Pronger's deal will be passed on by the league. Tagged as Chris Pronger, Ilya Kovalchuk, Marian Hossa, Mark Savard, NHLPA, philadelphia flyers, Roberto Luongo Kovalchuk ruling could put Pronger extension in jeopardy On Monday, arbitrator Richard Bloch made the ground-breaking ruling to uphold the NHL's right to abolish Ilya Kovalchuk's 17-year, $102 million deal with the New Jersey Devils, based on the grounds that the deal was created to circumvent the salary cap. But as the official news spread, general managers around the league began to tremble, because this ruling didn't just set a precedent for future deals — it could even change the past. For not only did Bloch tear apart the Kovalchuk deal, he mentioned, by name, the deals for Vancouver's Roberto Luongo, Boston's Marc Savard, Chicago's Marian Hossa and Philly's Chris Pronger, as example of infraction. Bloch wrote … "While the contracts have, in fact, been registered, their structure has not escaped League notice: those SPCs [standard player's contracts] are being investigated currently with at least the possibility of a subsequent withdrawal of the registration." Tagged as Chris Pronger, Marc Savard, Marian Hossa, philadelphia flyers, Roberto Luongo, Vancouver Canucks Sporting News: Pronger deal under league investigation One day after news broke that the NHL was looking into the 12-year deal that brought Marian Hossa to Chicago, a league insider told The Sporting News that the NHL has turned its omnipotent head toward Chris Pronger's seven-year deal with the Philadelphia Flyers.

Traditionally, literary beasts of the colonial era tended to reflect visions of an exoticised other, feared or desired. They provided texts with aesthetic but passive images, tropes of human desire, but were rarely displayed as creatures considered as themselves. Leconte de Lisle's poems, for example, abound with creatures that evoke nostalgia for civilisations gone-by; attraction to far away countries; and a yearning to escape from modernity and the day-to-day realities of western societies.

Place Beauvau (English: Beauvau Square) is a public square in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, at the intersection of the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honoré, Avenue de Marigny, Rue des Saussaies and Rue de Miromesnil. It is located in the La Madeleine neighbourhood, next to the Élysée Palace. Hôtel de Beauvau Place Beauvau is best known for the Hôtel de Beauvau, built by the architect Nicolas Le Camus de Mézières around 1770 for the prince, Charles Juste de Beauvau-Craon. In 1859, the Government of France purchased the building and installed the French governor-general of Algeria there. However, Victor Fialin, the duke of Persigny, who was Minister of the Interior under Napoleon III, arranged for his ministry to be moved from the Rue de Grenelle, in the 7th arrondissement, to this location. The Hôtel de Beauvau has housed the Ministry of the Interior since 1861; "Place Beauvau" is often used by French news-gathering organisations as shorthand for the ministry. The buildings to the north of the square are devoted to various services of the ministry. Nearby places of interest The Elysée Palace (Palais de l'Elysée), located on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, is the official residence of the President of the French Republic, where the president's office is located, and the Council of Ministers meets. Important foreign visitors are hosted at the nearby Hôtel de Marigny (not a hotel in the English sense, but a palatial residence.) The Service de Protection des Hautes Personnalités (SPHP) is a French national police unit in charge of the protection of high-profile personalities who visit France. It is located just a few steps off the Place Beauvau in the Rue de Miromesnil. Metro station The Place Beauvau is: It is served by lines 1, 8, 9, 12, 13, and 14.

I'm only slightly freaked out that there is only a month until Christmas, especially as my making is ever so massively running behind and I still have LOADS to do. Thank goodness I don't have a crazily busy few weeks ahead of me* and can just sit back and relax. But never mind, because it's almost time to get thinking about Share Advent, the wonderful idea thought up by Anna of Skin and Blister Blog. What could be better than taking part in some festive activities all the way to the big day? How great does this list look? I can't wait to get all festive with this list. *massive lies. I'm not freaking out about the busy-ness of the next few weeks at all! Honest. I LOVE share advent. I really hope I can do it next year as this is the SECOND year I have missed out! Missed out? Why? I think anyone can join in. But if you are moving you might not have time to i guess. Not at all, although you might be better linking back to Anna's posts. It is - join in! Oh, there is NO WAY i'll be blogging it all. that would push me over the edge ;) I might not even instagram the days I do do wither, but i'll be there in Christmas spirit!

Back in March we had the incredible opportunity to tour Japan for 6 days and the country made a lasting impression on all of us. Never have we been so welcomed into another community or treated so hospitably. From the start, we all were blown away by the beautiful sights and culture of Japan--some of the highlights were seeing the Toyko fish market, riding on the Bullet Train to Sendai, and walking the Philosopher's Path in Kyoto with the Cherry Blossoms in full bloom. But even more so, we were overwhelmed to witness firsthand the amazing bluegrass history and community in Japan. It was inspiring to see audience members mouthing the words to old Stanley Brothers tunes that we played at our performances, or to listen to eyewitness stories of bluegrass legends coming to tour Japan in years past, and especially to hear the incredible caliber of local bluegrass musicians around the country. It felt like they all knew more about bluegrass than we did! We can't thank Toshiaki Shimada enough for making this tour happen. He was delightful to work with, and we couldn't have dreamed of doing this without his vision and generous support. Also, we are so grateful for the tireless efforts of Takumi Kodera, Fumitaka Kato, and Tomoya Kawakatsu for traveling with us and making sure every detail was taken care of. We felt like we were in such good hands for the entire tour! And thanks to all of the wonderful people who came to our performances, drove us to gigs, and jammed with us after shows. It feels great knowing that we have such lovely friends on the other side of the world now. Needless to say, we are all anxious to come back. Some of us have even started to learn Japanese in anticipation of our next visit!
LOL!!! Watch the amazing dance challenge trending now all over the media where one falls down to the ground as a dance step. The dance step is really awesome and is trending all over the globe, take your time and watch.

Encyclopedia > Jacobin Jacobinism Redirected from Jacobin In the context of the French Revolution, a Jacobin originally meant a member of the Jacobin Club (1789 - 1794). But even while the Club still existed, the name of �Jacobins� had been popularly applied to all promulgators of extreme revolutionary opinions. In this sense the word passed beyond the borders of France and long survived the Revolution. Canning�s paper, The Anti-Jacobin, directed against the English Radicals, consecrated its use in England; and in the correspondence of Metternich and other leaders of the repressive policy which followed the second fall of Napoleon in 1815, "Jacobin" is the term commonly applied to anyone with Liberal tendencies, even to so august a personage as the emperor Alexander I of Russia. The English who supported the French Revolution during its early stages (or even throughout), were early known as Jacobins. These included the young Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, and others prior to their disillusionment at the outbreak of the Terror. Others, such as William Hazlitt and Tom Paine remained idealistic about the Revolution. Do not confuse Jacobinism with Jacobitism (note the "t"). Some text here is taken from a 1911 encyclopedia ...

Q: Most PowerApps users getting error "you don't have permission to view this data" I am a beginner in powerapps. I am trying to create app which can be used by employees of my organization and all are having Office 365 accounts. I have shared app with all user but only 3 users (including myself) are able to work on apps and other users are getting below error on first screen of my app. Error occurred when user open app: you don't have permission to view this data. server response : The HTTP request is unauthorized with client authentication scheme "Anonymous".The authentication header received from server was 'browser error in powerApps A: I had this problem trying to access MS Outlook and MS Teams. The error is extremely misleading. The problem was NOT that some administrator had disabled access in certain situations. The problem was resolved by going to the windows "Credential Manager" and deleting all the old credentials, forcing the MS apps to log you in again, and that then allows me to access those systems. No idea if this is your situation or not, but anyone receiving this error should first try deleting all the old credentials for that service. A: This typically means that your users do not have access to a Data Source used by the PowerApp. When you click File/Share and enter a person/groups name, you will see on the right hand side something to the effect of: Here are all the data sources your users will need permission to.

Q: How join annotate value of QuerySet and property field of Model to one logic in Django? I have this situation. I calculate a diameter in two ways: annotate of QuerySet and property in Model. class CircleQuerySet(models.QuerySet): def annotate_diameter(self): return self.annotate(diameter=models.F('radius')*2) class Circle(models.Model): radius = models.DecimalField(max_digits=11, decimal_places=2) objects = CircleQuerySet.as_manager() @property def diameter(self): return self.radius * 2 How can I join this two ways to one? Is it exists? A: You can add a setter for the diameter property so that you do not get errors when trying to add an annotation of the same name @property def diameter(self): return self.radius * 2 @diameter.setter def diameter(self, value): return As for only having the calculation in one place, it is not possible because the annotation is a database instruction and you still need the property for objects that are not retrieved from the database. You could add the annotation to every query by overriding the get_queryset method of the manager so that even .get() will return an object with the annotation.

Donald Trump, USA Kavanaugh confirmation hearing: Here's what Christine Blasey Ford said and how everyone responded Blasey's By Prarthana Mitra Under historic, dramatic and extraordinary circumstances, professor Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the US Senate Judiciary Committee to address Ford's sexual assault allegation against the US Supreme Court nominee. Ford, a college psychology professor, has alleged that Kavanaugh attacked her during a party in the 1980s when they were high school students. Notably, two other women have also accused the judge of assault. Despite the allegations and calls for his nomination process to be halted until an investigation is conducted, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-10 to forward Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate – but on the condition of an FBI investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations. As a result, a full Senate vote on Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation has been postponed by a week. What is Kavanaugh accused of? According to Ford, in the summer of 1982, a drunk teenaged Kavanaugh ambushed her at a house party, pinned her to a bed groping and trying to disrobe her, placing his hand over her mouth to silence her and keep her from screaming. Mark Judge, Kavanaugh's friend and classmate from Georgetown Preparatory School, was allegedly present in the room at the time and amused by the incident, until he collapsed on top of the two, enabling Ford to escape. Judge's memoir records that they were heavy drinkers at the time, although Kavanaugh has categorically denied this. Ford first came detailed the alleged assault to Democrat Diane Feinstein and later in an interview with The Washington Post. Prior to this, she had discussed the alleged assault with her therapist in 2012 and her partner when they met in 2002, long before Kavanaugh was in the running for Supreme Court judgeship. In addition to Ford's accusations, Kavanaugh is also accused of assaulting Deborah Ramirez while in college. Ramirez claims that he exposed himself to her and pushed his genitals in her face at a party when they were both studying at Yale University in the 1980s. A third woman, Julie Swetnick, has also come forward to claim that Kavanaugh attended parties where women were drugged, assaulted and raped. Swetnick says she was raped at one of these parties where Kavanaugh and Judge were present, although she did not accuse the former of her rape. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations. What Ford said at the hearing On Thursday, after a long campaign that saw her derided (importantly by US President Donald Trump and his family) and supported in equal measure (giving rise to the #WhyIDidn'tReport movement), Ford was invited to testify before the committee. She asserted that although it was tough for her to speak, it was her civic duty that had driven her to take the stand. "I believed he was going to rape me," she said of the alleged assault, delivering a powerful testimony before answering their questions with logic and composure. Sen. Patrick Leahy: What is the "strongest memory" of the incident? Christine Blasey Ford: "The laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense" https://t.co/x71KG2LMVL #KavanaughHearings pic.twitter.com/rqqEAOYYni — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 27, 2018 "Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter — the uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense," she said. Ford responded to all the questions put forward by Rachel Mitchell, a veteran prosecutor appointed by the Republicans, concerning the grizzly details and the vile epithets hurled at her since she came forward. She also addressed concerns regarding her political motives. "I have been accused of acting out of partisan political motives," she said. "Those who say that do not know me. I am a fiercely independent person, and I am no one's pawn. My motivation in coming forward was to provide the facts about how Mr. Kavanaugh's actions have damaged my life, so that you can take that into serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed." What Kavanaugh said Kavanaugh vehemently denied the charges and gave non-committal answers to the questions posed to him. This comes after he expressed having regrets about his choices in high school. In his opening statement, he spoke about his childhood, family, school life and his illustrious career, which he maintained was clean. He broke down speaking of his daughters who he said had prayed for Ford night before, and asserted his innocence based on a calendar he maintained during his teenage years. Kavanaugh could also not refrain from lashing out at the Democrats, saying, "This confirmation process has become a national disgrace." "The Constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process, but you have replaced 'advice and consent' with 'search and destroy,'" he continued. Some were unnerved by his lack of humility, especially when he said, "You may defeat me in the final vote, but you will never get me to quit. Never." While Ford has passed a polygraph test on the alleged assault and has asked for an independent FBI probe into the facts, Kavanaugh has categorically refused both (despite saying he favours due process), even claiming that he was not present at the party where Ford claims the assault occurred. In fact, Kavanaugh even declared before the Senate that hers was a case of mistaken identity even as she testified that her memory serves her right, citing clinical reasons for why she was absolutely right about it. Thousands came out in support of Ford during the testimony, with many gathered across the country, including outside the Senate and near the schools Ford and Kavanaugh attended. Democrat Kamala Harris acknowledged Ford's courage and thanked her for her patriotism and for testifying against a powerful man when she had nothing to gain from it. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham echoed Kavanaugh's thoughts on the confirmation process when he addressed his opponents across the dais, saying, "What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020," he said. He told his Republican colleagues, "If you vote no, you're legitimising the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics." The American Bar Association and the dean of the Yale Law School, which Kavenaugh attended, have called for an investigation the allegations. Dean Gerken Joins the ABA in Calling for Further Investigation. pic.twitter.com/SYAsVHwsi7 — Yale Law School (@YaleLawSch) September 28, 2018 Meanwhile, soon after Kavanaugh's testimony, Trump tweeted that "Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him" after the hearing adjourned, urging the Senate to vote immediately. He later acknowledged Ford's account as credible. The testimonies were followed by a discussion where each senator put forward their takeaways from the nine hour-long session and voiced their decisions to vote for or against the nominee. When the senators reconvened, Republican senator Jeff Flake backed Kavanaugh but stood up against taking the final vote without an independent FBI investigation. The Democrats now need another defection to overturn this nomination (50 votes), unless the FBI finds concrete evidence during their "limited" inquiry and background check. Considering how important this nomination is for the Republicans, who desperately want a more conservative judiciary, Kavanaugh may have crossed his first hurdle but continues to be on trial.

Me and a Guy Named Elvis My Lifelong Friendship with Elvis Presley by Jerry Schilling and Chuck Crisafulli Jerry Schilling Chuck Crisafulli Ona lazy Sunday in 1954, twelve-year old Jerry Schilling wandered into a Memphis touch football game, only to discover that his team was quarterbacked by a nineteen-year old Elvis Presley, the local teenage whose first record, "That's All Right," had just debuted on Memphis radio. The two became fast friends, even as Elvis turned into the world's biggest star. In 1964, Elvis invited Jerry to work for him as part of his "Memphis Mafia," and Jerry soon found himself living with Elvis full-time in a Bel Air mansion and, later in his own room at Graceland. Over the next thirteen years Jerry would work for Elvis in various capacities-from bodyguard to photo double to co-executive producer on a karate film. But more than anything else he was Elvis's close friend and confidant: Elvis trusted Jerry with protecting his life when he received death threats, he asked Jerry to drive him and Pricilla to the hospital the day Lisa Marie was born and to accompany him during the famous "lost weekend" when he traveled to meet President Nixon at the White House. Me and a Guy Named Elvis looks at Presley from a friend's perspective, offering readers the man rather than the icon-including insights into the creative frustrations that lead to Elvis's abuse of prescription medicine and his tragic death. Jerry offers never-before-told stories about life inside Elvis's inner circle and an emotional recounting of the great times, hard times, and unique times he and Elvis shared. These vivid memories will be priceless to Elvis's millions of fans, and the compelling story will fascinate an even wider audience.

Let me start by saying that I am a supporter of Wikipedia, I contribute articles and information wherever I think I have sufficient knowledge. I also contribute annually a certain amount to Wikipedia donations. Having said that, it does hurt me sometimes when people rubbish you if you quote them something from wikipedia or you give them a wikipedia link in an attempt to prove your point. People who don't know how wikipedia works or have very little surface knowledge seem to disregard it with much ease. I read somewhere about an article that how teachers in most school discredit any wikipedia sources of research. Yes they dislike it because in many cases it contradicts their text books. In reality, Wikipedia is a mighty flattener of the world by providing free access and authoring capability of information to general public. Let me quote an example, have you heard of the famous saying, "History is written by conquerors"? Not anymore. With rising popularity of Wikipedia, every piece of historical article is being subjected to views from all directions. One such example would be the role of "Aryan Invasion Theory" in Indian history. For more than one century we have heard the Aryan Invasion theory and taken it as practical history, of course until now. Without going into the details, you will notice Wikipedia article on the subject seems to stay neutral by presenting both sides of the argument. Now coming to the original intention of writing this article, I propose to write first an algorithm and then a practical implementation of the algorithm as a web service/site that other applications can use. Yes, everything will be open source and free. The purpose of the algorithm would be to present the reader with a version of the wikipedia page (or for that matter any wiki page) that the algorithm thinks is the most stable/reliable version. How the algorithm will work is a set of steps that I will be detailing next. Check if the author has made edits to other pages, if yes, look at the activity interval. If there are rapid edits, the author could be spammer. If the edit made was very recent, mark it as "Recent Edits" and "Candidate for Removal". This could just turn out to be the quick moderator you need while browsing the excellent and superb Wikipedia! And this doesnt just apply to wikipedia, it also applies to Technical wikis we use at work. There are many people writing and modifying wiki pages. If its a big organization, I bet there are many new joinees and interns who are not necessarily the most trusted people to edit wikis. However, the best use of it is on public wiki sites where trust worthiness of an article becomes a big question for few. Previous PostPrevious The best Buddhist music ever!
New Jets Uniforms Coming Spring 2019 Eric Allen The Jets will have a brand new look in 2019. The franchise will unveil new uniforms next April and the Jets will wear their ensemble beginning in their 60th season of play. Nailed it. #JetsNewUnis https://t.co/lyJUf2uE7c — New York Jets (@nyjets) July 29, 2018 After starting as the Titans of New York and sporting a navy, gold and white combination from 1960-62, the team was renamed the Jets prior to the 1963 season and kelly green and white became synonymous with the upstarts from the American Football League. There have been three major uniform alterations since. The last one came prior to the 1998 campaign when Bill Parcells oversaw a color change from kelly green to hunter green and removed black as an accent color while paying homage to the Super Bowl III championship team with a modified version of the oval on the helmet that was used from 1965-77. Suspense will build in the months prior to a highly anticipated reveal. As far as all the details, we'll have to wait until April. But change is on the horizon. Note: There will be no changes to the current uniform for the upcoming season. The Jets will wear their "Color Rush" uniforms one time in 2018 as they'll be in all green when they host the Minnesota Vikings in Week 7.

My name is Andraž and I´m 21 years old. I´ve just seen one of your presentations on youtube about glucosamine and I have one question. I´m training gymnastics and I was operated on my shoulder - the diagnosis was SLAP LAESIO or slap shoulder. So they fixed my sinew of long head of biceps brachii. I had this operation about 4 years ago. It is quite ok now, but I was thinking about taking glucosamine as a dietary supplement. But I don´t know which product to choose. Should I take glucosamine in combination with higher amount of chondroitin or the one with higher MSM? Because I don´t know which component is better for ˝repairing˝ sinew (because it differs a little bit from cartilage). So, is it better to take (beside glucosamine of course) higher doses of chondroitin or MSM? Andraz, while glucosamine will not directly benefit the particular joint injury you have suffered (You have damaged the joint capsule and tendons - not the cartilage joint surfaces) it will certainly do you no harm. This is because glucosamine and chondroitin do assist with maintaining healthy collagen of which your damaged tissues mainly consist of. MSM will assist with restoring collagen to good health and has a healthy natural anti-inflammatory effect. Probably the best combination for a young person in your situation is the Balance Joint Repair for Athletes. This covers all bases. Add Active Elements 2.1 - 2-4 tablets per day to supply silica and calcium flouride which maintain strong and flexible collagen. Deficiency in these shows in the body as hard and inflexible tendons and ligaments, poor skin, hair and nails, including heels that crack. Ensure your diet is rich in a wide range of unprocessed fats and oils. Each meal should have a little quality protein in it rather than all the protein being lumped into a single meal. Combine this nutrition with a weekly sports massage of the shoulder girdle and regular stretching. Review progress in about three months and adjust therapies accordingly.

However, the container walls will keep the roots held, and prevent the plant from consuming too much of your garden space. TIP! It is important to follow the instructions on your chemicals and tools closely, especially if you are new to gardening.

Q&A with Oakland Athletics competitive balance round pick Jeremy Eierman The 70th overall pick in the 2018 draft, Jeremy Eierman hit eight home runs in his pro debut season. Donald Moore Jeremy Eierman hit eight home runs for Vermont / Photo by Greg Bessette Editor's note: These interviews took place midseason, but personal circumstances prevented us from publishing them at the time of the interviews. We still wanted to share them even if they are a few months after the fact. Thank you! Going into the 2018 MLB Draft, Jeremy Eierman was one of the most talked about college shortstops available. After hitting 23 home runs and posting a 1106 OPS for Missouri State as a sophomore, he entered his junior season as a potential top-15 pick. Eierman endured an up-and-down junior season with MSU, hitting 10 home runs in 56 games and swiping 21 bases but also seeing his OPS dip to 895. The A's picked up the power-hitting middle infielder with the 70th-overall selection. Eierman spent his pro debut season with short-season Vermont and he played 62 games. Eierman showed prodigious power and hit eight home runs in a league not known for power. He also stole 10 bases. However, Eierman struck out 70 times and posted an overall slashline of .235/.283/.381. Donald Moore spoke with Eierman during the season about his transition to pro ball. Donald Moore: Hi Jeremy, how is everything going for you so far this season? Jeremy Eierman: It's going good. Getting used to the live pros right now and I'm just two weeks into it now, so having a lot of fun and getting to know the guys and everything, so it's good. DM: What are your goals for this year? JE: To get used to the pros a little bit and learn everyday and just go out and have fun. DM: What do you feel is your greatest strength as a ball player? JE: I feel as though I can do everything well. My power kinds of stands out for me and playing a power position keeps my skill set pretty intriguing. DM: What would you'd like to improve on? JE: A little bit more consistency at the plate . Sometimes I get a little off my power so I'm trying to get more consistent at-bats. DM: How are you acclimating to professional baseball? JE: Good and the main thing is getting used to the grind. It's not like college. Pro ball is everyday and you make adjustments a lot faster, and that's the main thing when it comes down to it. Making your adjustments much quicker. DM: What do you like best about being a professional athlete? JE: Everything about it is great. Being a professional baseball player has been a dream of mine my whole life. Finally being able to do it and now I'm giving it my best shot. It's a dream come true. DM: What is the hardest thing about being a pro? JE: I don't think everything is crazy hard. It's nothing I have never seen. But that's the main thing, it's baseball and have fun. DM: Any pre-game routines? JE: Not really. I just do the same thing every day. DM: Any hobbies? JE: Hunting and fishing. I'm an outdoorsman, so that's basically it. DM: Favorite baseball team growing up? JE: Probably the Royals. I'm from Missouri, but I'm not huge on the Cardinals/Royals rivalry. That's kind of a split deal in Missouri, but other than that, I'd probably lean towards the Royals. DM: Where are you originally from? JE: Warsaw, Missouri. DM: If there is one person that taught you the most about baseball, who would that be? JE: Probably my dad. He's been there for me my whole life and brought me into the game. (His father, John, played in the minors for the Red Sox, and his brother, John, was drafted by Rays in 2011.) DM: Craziest thing you have ever seen on a baseball diamond? JE: We (Missouri State) had a bench clearing brawl against Kansas. It was the craziest thing I have ever seen. It was wild. DM: Any off-season plans?

Choeun Panha, 33, a resident of Phnom Penh's Rik Reay community, watches from her window as developers move in Sunday. LINKING arms to form a human chain, about a hundred residents of Phnom Penh's Rik Reay community stood in front of four machines dumping sand into their community in an attempt to prevent development work on Saturday. Undeterred, workers for Bassac Garden City turned on the machines - pushing sand around and over the feet of the protesters, while others aimed guns at them, a local resident said. "They pointed guns to get us to unlock our arms, and then they proceeded to push dirt at our legs because we refused to back down," said Chan Bunthol, 39, a community representative and one of the protesters. Rath Kumnith, a legal adviser to Canadia Bank, which is providing a loan toBassac Garden City to fund the development, was unavailable for comment on Sunday. Chan Bunthol said as a result of his protests he fears for his safety. "They want to arrest me because they've accused me of being a gangster, but I am only trying to protect my home," he said. Heng Samphos, another community representative who has lived in Rik Reay since 1990, said the protesters also placed a giant Cambodian flag on the ground but that the development machines drove on top of it - proof, Heng Samphos said, "that they look down on our nation". Sim Vay, the deputy chief of Village 8 said, "It is very hard to help people here. ... They asked me to talk to the Bassac Garden City owner to get a higher price [for compensation], and after I talked with the owner they agreed to increase the price by US$1,500, but people rejected it." The deputy chief said the protesters "did not want to help our village but only to make trouble by themselves". Khat Narith, the Tonle Bassac commune chief, said that Bassac Garden City filled their own property: "It is not related to residents' land," he said. "Now, there are only about 50 families out of 219 who refuse compensation because they want to get between $100,000 and $150,000 for each family," he said, adding, "The company has the land titles to the land - which the people do not - so people don't have rights to that land. I think the company's compensation is enough for them because their houses are small, wooden and dilapidated," he added. But Bunn Rachana, a monitor for the Housing Rights Task Force, said the company's actions were illegal, even if the company did hold the land title. "What the company did with the Rik Reay community is against the people's housing rights because it is under negotiation. But the company filled up the land ... [to] put pressure on people to accept their compensation," Bunn Rachana said. The Housing Rights Task Force released a statement on Sunday calling on the Bassac Garden City company to negotiate in good faith with the community and to halt all activities on the land. The statement said the filling of the land was "in direct violation of the possession rights of community members, as guaranteed in the 2001 Land Law and the 1993 Constitution of Cambodia". In its submission to the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights from early April, Amnesty International wrote: "Cambodian law does not include a clear prohibition on forced eviction and only provides a limited and weak degree of protection against forced evictions." Amnesty International's submission highlighted a dearth of effective legal remedies for villagers like the ones at Rik Reay community who feel they were unlawfully evicted, saying it was "not aware of any instance in which victims of forced eviction have been able to acquire restitution through litigation". The Amnesty submission specifically mentioned the alternative housing offered to the Rik Reay community as "inadequate" and called the compensation "insufficient".
[Leaflet] Only Socialism Beats Trump! US Section of the IMT Americans are sick of the status quo and want a change. They want to take their destinies into their own hands. Millions of workers and young people are digesting the bitter pill of the failure of lesser evilism. They are truly traumatized, genuinely saddened, and understandably disturbed. They cannot imagine a world in which a bigoted billionaire bully is the top official in American political life. But countless others are outraged, viscerally affected, and ready to fight. While the liberal apologists for the crimes and failures of Clinton and the Democrats panicked and despaired, the instincts of the radicalized youth have come alive. This is the Sanders movement 2.0, no longer attempting to transform the Democrats through primaries and caucuses, but pouring into the streets to make it clear that we refuse to live in a country where racism, sexism, homophobia, poverty, unemployment, and homelessness are allowed to fester. The enthusiasm and élan of these protests is a sight to behold. It shows the revolutionary potential that exists in hundreds of cities large and small across this continent of a country. The demonstrations and meetings must and should continue. However, if the workers and youth of America and the world are to have a better future, protesting will not be enough. Our historic task is not merely to register our discontent with the system, but to end it once and for all. Trump is neither the genuine face nor the future of America. Nearly half of all eligible voters abstained from the election altogether. Millions fewer bothered to vote this time around than in 2008 or 2012, despite a growing population. Barely 25% of the voting population cast a ballot for Trump. Many of them did so to protest the status quo, despite his bigotry, not because of it. Life teaches and we learn from experience. Trump's victory will serve as wake-up call, a harsh reminder that change cannot merely "believed in" or "hoped for" in the abstract. It will not come by voting for the parties of the status quo. It will have to be fought for. Americans are sick of the status quo and want a change. They want to take their destinies into their own hands. They want quality jobs, healthcare, education, security and a rising quality of life for themselves and their loved ones. Under capitalism, none of this is possible. Whether they know it yet or not, what they want is a socialist revolution. That is the path we are now on. It won't be easy, and it won't be overnight, but we can make this a reality in our lifetimes. The clear lesson of Tuesday's election is that, in the words of Frederick Douglass, "if there is no struggle, there is no progress." Life is struggle and we should embrace it. What lies ahead is an exciting era of struggle for a better life for all. This should fill us with enthusiasm, resolve, and optimism for the future. Join the International Marxist Tendency in the struggle for a better world!

'I Was Interested In How Taylor & Axe Were Going To Get Along': Asia Kate Dillon On Season 5 Of Showtime's 'Billions' Filed Under:Asia Kate Dillon, Damian Lewis, DJ Sixsmith, Maggie Siff, Only CBS, Paul Giamatti, Showtime (CBS Local)– "Billions" is back on Showtime for season five and things are about to get interesting as Taylor Mason is back at Axe Capital. Asia Kate Dillon has been a trailblazer in their portrayal of the non-binary character Mason and Dillon is excited for fans to check out season five of the series. "We got through shooting seven episodes and we were shooting episode eight when we shut down production," said Dillon in an interview with CBS Local's DJ Sixsmith. "The first seven episodes are going to come out and we still have to film the back half of the season. I went into this season like I do every season with excitement and curiosity. I know very little about what's going to happen ahead of time. Certain things the producers will let me know, but for the most part I like to be surprised. This season, I was particularly interested in how Taylor and Axe were going to get along, now that Taylor is back at Axe Capital. Also, I was really interested in how the relationship between Taylor and Wendy Rhoades was going to develop." While the relationship between Bobby Axelrod, played by Damian Lewis, and Chuck Rhoades, played by Paul Giamatti, is the headliner of the show, the relationship between Mason and Maggie Siff's character Wendy Rhoades is one of the most fascinating of the series. "That relationship has really suffered some serious blows," said Dillon. "Last season was a game of cat and mouse and who was the cat and who was the mouse and we were both cats. This season, I was excited to see those relationships developed. Taylor and Wendy… they can't get away with anything with each other. Even last season, when Taylor is pulling one over on Wendy or Wendy is pulling one over on Taylor, I think they're both always aware that's a possibility. They've thought about the contingency plan if that's a possibility. I think every time Wendy double crossed Taylor last season, Taylor was both deeply hurt and very impressed. They both respect and love each other to some extent." Watch a new episode of "Billions" this Sunday, May 10 on Showtime at 9pm EST/PST and on stream the series on Showtime Anytime.

Depression screening rates remain extremely low. Even with the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPTF) recommending that all adults over the age of 18 should be screened, depression screening numbers remains minuscule. Estimates from a recent report published in Psychiatric Services signal to less than five percent of adults currently being screened in America. Even as the primary care setting is often the first entrance into interacting with the health care system, many people are not being appropriately identified to start receiving the care that they need. "The findings suggest missed opportunities for depression screening in the general population," said Ayse Akincigil, co-author of the study. When nearly one out of five Americans are battling some form of mental health condition, it is imperative that people can quickly assess whether they are experiencing depression. Estimates also point to the fact that over half of those with mental health conditions receive some form of care. Of those people who do receive care, it is estimated that only about 13 percent receive something that is effective for them to feel better. There is a way to better align and connect the primary care physicians along healthcare's continuum of care with the needed assessments that are not currently being taken. These conditions, when not dealt with properly, are connected to tremendous costs to the system. A leading health policy publication, Heath Affairs, named mental health conditions are the costliest medical condition in America. Depression screenings have been suggested since 2002. Often the screening is covered by Medicare and private insurers, however the existing model of assessment is not effective. There is a new, potentially easier, and more accessible way to screen for depression. Thanks to a partnership with the National Science Foundation, Chicago-based Prevail Health has developed an online behavioral health solution that begins with a clinical and demographic assessment to build a robust profile of the User. The health assessment is known as a health quiz that can easily be done on any phone, tablet, or computer that it is internet-enabled. Tens of thousands of Users have already taken the health quiz to have a better understanding of their current situation, as well as begin receiving care to improve. Want to take a health quiz to find out your health status? Try it here now.

We were very privileged to be introduced to the Fashion entrepreneur, trends guru and media personality Craig Jacobs just a few weeks ago, when the organiser of The East Rand Wedding Show turned to us and said – "do you think you can fit him in?". Fit him in…fall over ourselves to fit him in is more like the expression we have in mind. Have a look at the Shoot…. I had better paint a picture for you before we all get lost in this Blog. We are producing the Fashion Show at the inaugural Wedding showcase to be held at Emperors Palace this winter – 12/13 July 2014 to be precise. The event promises to set a new bench mark in the industry as it is the first event of its kind to be held in the East Rand of Johannesburg, but in particular because it is hosting the first ever #PowerHalfHour Fashion Show, an idea conceptualised by FranklyWild. If you're wondering what it is, and how it all works, you'd better make sure you book yourself a ticket. We will tell you though that it is going to be the 'FashionWeek' of Wedding Shows! So Who is Craig Jacobs and what does he do? This is the part where everyone always takes three long paragraphs to tell us what we already know, so we're not going to do that. Let's keep it simple, and let's keep it real. Craig popped into our Studio for a Photo Shoot on Thursday. Let's tell you in one sentence about the man – he is uncomplicated, really easy to chat too, and can't do enough for you. If you want to know more about Craig, and what he does, and what Fundudzi is, then pop past the East Rand Wedding Show at Emperors Palace in a couple of weeks and we'll show you during our #PowerHalfHourFashionShow…! You may even get to chat to him at the Fashion Installation. Before I sign off on this Blog, we're really excited to be hosting Craig as one of the designers during our Maiden PowerHalfHour shows, and even though we didn't know we'd have Craig at the time we conceptualised it, this is exactly why we came up with the idea!

The Saratoga Performing Arts Center will receive $1.75 million in state funds to pay for improvements to its amphitheater. Due to be completed before the beginning of next summer's season, the upgrades will include new surfaces, railings and panels for the ramps from the SPAC lawn to the amphitheater balcony, and new lighting that will preserve SPAC's signature globe lamps but will be more energy efficient. News of the funding, provided by the state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, was announced Wednesday at SPAC's annual members meeting, held in the Hall of Springs, adjacent to SPAC's grounds in the Saratoga Spa State Park. In other news from the meeting, two public radio stations, Troy-based WMHT and WRTI in Philadelphia, will broadcast four Philadelphia Orchestra concerts that will be recorded at SPAC this summer. The recordings also will be available for listening on the orchestra's website. Elizabeth Sobol, SPAC's president and CEO, said it will be the first time in the orchestra's 52 years of SPAC residency that SPAC concerts will be broadcast on WRTI and the first time that WMHT has dedicated a series to SPAC performances. Sobol also announced that SPAC is partnering with miSci, the Museum of Science and Innovation in Schenectady, to present the "Out of this World Festival," which will explore art and the cosmos. Related events will take place throughout August, starting off with the Philadelphia Orchestra's performance of Holst's "The Planets," complete with NASA space footage shown on screens. Audiences will be able to star-gaze with at telescopes around SPAC's reflecting pool and attend events for adults and children, including a new speaker series featuring thinkers engaged in the arts and sciences. In another collaborative effort, SPAC, SaratogaArtsFest and Saratoga Shakespeare Company will present "Shakespeare in the Pines" on July 20, which will feature a one-hour musical adaptation of "Romeo & Juliet" prior to that evening's New York City Ballet performance. Finally, Sobol said SPAC will host its first Festival of Young Artists on June 3 on SPAC's grounds. The free festival will bring 450 young dancers, musicians, singers, poets and visual artists from around the Capital Region with events including a poetry slam, student art show, pop-up performances and large concert featuring the Empire State Youth Orchestra, the Capital District Youth Chorale and Northeast Ballet Company.
Traumatized veteran's spouse debates her future in DeVita play MADISON - Learning that her husband has survived a roadside bombing in Iraq with apparently minimal, shrapnel-induced damage, stateside wife Elise Sabato can be forgiven for counting her chickens before they've hatched. "I find myself watching random homecoming videos on YouTube," Elise tells us in "Learning to Stay," a world premiere from Forward Theater that opened over the weekend under Jennifer Uphoff Gray's direction. Adapted by James DeVita from the novel by Madison-based writer Erin Celello, "Learning to Stay" is set in 2010 Madison. It chronicles what happens after the celebratory homecoming video ends and real life begins again. In the case of Elise (Kat Wodtke) and Brad (Jeb Burris), real life doesn't mean the old life, back when Elise saw Brad as "the kindest, smartest man I've ever met, equal parts patient and handsome" as well as a surefire winner as a future Dad. That description comes from the novel. Although DeVita follows Celello's lead, giving us a memory play told from Elise's point of view, his adaptation doesn't convey much sense of the Brad who was. That makes it harder to grasp why Elise might stay with the Brad who is: a "ghost" wounded in body and mind who drinks too much and is prone to frightening violence. Burris accurately channels the rage consuming the new Brad; late in the play, he'll provide us with back story of an all-too familiar sort, confirming anew that war is indeed hell. But this isn't really his story. "Learning to Stay" belongs instead to Elise, with Wodtke toggling between narration of the scenes she describes and reliving them in real time. Those narrative passages are insufficiently dramatized, in the script or on stage; ditto many moments belonging to a four-person chorus, playing multiple, singly dimensioned characters and saddled with too many earnest and sometimes chalky expository passages. There's also an unfortunate subplot involving the law firm where Elise works; its stereotyped characters and environment don't track the way people behave in an actual law firm, particularly in a city like Madison. More important, that subplot pulls focus from the story that counts, here: Whether Elise should stick it out with Brad or start over. Watching Wodtke actually interact with Burris plays to Wodtke's strength as an actor: an ability to capture the tension between ostensible calm and underlying despair that's all the better and more poignant because it's not overplayed. Dramatizing that story, amplified by further attention to the stories of two other women – one who lost her husband in Iraq (Malkia Stampley) and another leaving the damaged man who returned (Karen Moeller) – would give DeVita's script more focus. In its current iteration, its commendable attention to the details of Celello's novel is stifling its emergence as a play. "Learning to Stay" continues through April 9 at the Overture Center, 201 State St., Madison. For tickets, visit forwardtheater.com/. To read more about this production, go to TapMilwaukee.com. Filed Away and Forgotten: The huge towers of upstage filing cabinets in Mike Lawler's scenic design conjure many images. The law firm where Elise works. The perimeter of an embattled Iraqi safe zone. The nightmarish bureaucracy couples like Elise and Brad must navigate in seeking medical help. The "cabinet full" of medications that Brad must now take. The way we reductively pigeonhole veterans and categorize the mentally ill. And the way soldiers like Brad are trapped within their minds, reliving experiences they don't know how to share. A Foundation Made of Sand: Lawler has rimmed Forward's thrust stage with sand. That suggests Iraq, always surrounding and lying beneath the seemingly stable American world to which Brad returns. Those desert sands also suggest the shifting and unreliable foundation on which Elise and Brad must now try to build a new life. A Greek Chorus: When they're not each busy playing multiple characters, the four ensemble members surrounding this play's central couple serve as a Greek chorus, particularly effective in moments in which they underscore and further dramatize Elise's ruminations – as they do, for example, immediately after Elise's opening monologue. They also often remain onstage between scenes in which they're appearing as characters; as Uphoff Gray pointed out in a talkback following Sunday afternoon's performance, doing so allows them to bear witness to a story that affects all of us. As Uphoff Gray additionally noted, keeping the ensemble onstage also facilitates transitions, in a script with many – too many – truncated scenes. In addition to Moeller and Stampley, this production's ensemble members are Di'Monte Henning and Michael Herold. An Iliad: DeVita's play follows his unforgettable performances in two productions of "An Iliad," in which he plays the Poet, struggling to make sense of war while cataloging what it's done to who we are and the world in which we live. Interviewing him before the first of those productions at the Milwaukee Repertory Theater in 2014, it was clear that this reliably thoughtful artist had already given considerable attention to the phenomenon of war and its tremendous collateral damage. He and Uphoff Gray deserve kudos for deciding three years ago to write and stage a play like this one; they did so long before the "theater of war" became a hot-button topic in the theater world (it's featured on the cover and in several articles in the current issue of American Theatre, which has profiled DeVita's play). A Performance for Veterans: Consistent with the commitment that gave birth to this play, Forward has scheduled a private performance of "Learning to Stay" that's intended exclusively for veterans, their families and service providers. It will be followed by an in-depth discussion with Uphoff Gray, her cast, and Veterans Administration personnel. It's free; details and registration for those eligible to attend are available here: www.wisvetsmuseum.com/events/?ID=191.

The company who makes Narcan will chip in in order to off set costs of the opiate blocker. The producers of the opioid overdose reversal drug Narcan, will pay into a new state trust fund to help make the medication more affordable to first responders in Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced. Since the beginning of the heroin and pain medication crisis, the price of Narcan(Naloxone) shot up given the high demand. Healey announced that her office has come up with a solution by partnering with Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, making a $325,000 deal to offset the costs of the drug. This program is the first of its kind payment from the manufacturer that will go into the Commonwealth's Municipal Naloxone Bulk Purchase Trust Fund, which will provide the nasal spray version of Narcan at a bulk equivalent to 10,000 units. The initial fund made 15,000 doses available with $150,000 in state funding. But the demand continues to increase in order for first responders to stand a chance at the growing opioid epidemic. The cost of Narcan jumped from $15 a dose to about $44 in 2014. Healey hopes that buying the opioid blocker in bulk will stabilize the costs. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office struck a similar deal with Amphastar cuts the wholesale price by 20 percent, and includes a $6 rebate per dose in February 2014. Last spring, the NYPD began training officers on how to use naloxone, and outfitting officers with kits. Eventually, 19,500 officers will carry the kits. In less than a year, Schneiderman's office gave $1.8 million to state police departments for naloxone kit reimbursements. Monday's announcement came as the world marked International Overdose Awareness Day. Since August, Narcan has been used to save 129 lives in Worcester alone. Quincy became the first city in the nation to require police officers to carry Narcan, and has saved 95 percent of the victims treated. Statewide, first responders used 11,000 doses of Narcan last year.
LS&K is the project of us, Nina and Bek –a Sydney-based sister duo who shared a joint love of all things green and beautiful objects – hence the tag line 'wild green things, domesticated'. We wanted to create vessels that would enhance internal spaces but be flexible; that would work equally for renters (who can't put hooks in walls) or homeowners. Our ceramics can be hung off picture rails, sat flat on tables, exist in pairs, bunches or individually. And we love having fun with the up-cycled pieces. We adore traipsing antique stores and op-shops and gathering our friends to write entertaining stories around them, for example, meet Mary. We are just five months old – we participated in our first ever market in November last year. It was a great market test and we got awesome feedback that we've taken back into our business. Allow plenty of prep time and try not to be anxious – you'll be amongst one of the most supportive communities we've encountered. On a practical level – get the Paypal handset – so simple and transacts directly via your phone. We couldn't have lived without it. Tell us something exciting that you have planned for Leafsmith & Kin this year? Figuring out the next level of logistics – going online! We've also got a few product ideas that are sitting at the concept stage that we're keen to realise. The creative people around us. So fun to bounce ideas off. That's hard – overall the diversity of application – the ability to sneak a cheeky pot in any space, whether that be on a window sill or hanging from a picture rail. Having said that we both love the story-telling aspect of the Will & Blanche series – we only had a handful at the last market but we're planning to have a lot more for this next market.

Products and services are marketed in surprisingly similar ways. Both products and services flood the marketplace to meet the needs and desires of diverse consumer groups. While many companies focus on either products or services, many begin with a singular focus and then add either services or products to further meet their customer's needs and enhance their company's sales. However, while there are both similarities and distinctions of goods and services in terms of what consumers purchase, the general approach in your marketing strategy can be strikingly similar. Although there is a difference between product and service offerings, they are similar in a number of ways. Products are generally physical items, such as automobiles, tissue paper or personal computers. Services, on the other hand, are intangible and are derived from an individual's action, such as tax preparation services, car washes or guided tours. Still, both products and services exist to meet needs in the marketplace and both rely on demand from target customer groups. Both products and services attempt to provide value to individuals, families or businesses, and both rely on marketing to stimulate demand and motivate consumers to make purchasing decisions. Marketing comprises a range of specific activities, all of which can be employed to promote either products or services. As far as strategies are concerned, product and service marketing are highly related activities. Marketing comprises a range of efforts, all of which can be employed to promote either products or services. Advertising, promotional drives and public relations activities are among the tools used to drive sales. Advertising is the most visible component of marketing, comprising one-way messages sent over mass market and other media. It begins with a specific purpose and seeks to communicate a primary message to the consumer. Advertisements can be created to inform customers of new offerings, remind customers about established brands, encourage repeat purchases or brand switching or to stimulate momentum for upcoming promotional activities. Promotions is the branch of marketing concerned with encouraging customers to try products or services or to make repeat purchases. Promotions offer perks like discount coupons, in-store sales and loyalty reward programs. Promotions may combine product and service offerings. For example, with the purchase of a new appliance, customers may receive a free service cleaning or a discount on accessories. Public relations is the arm of marketing concerned with managing relationships with public entities, including the government and news organizations. Monetary donations to local charities and sending press releases to the local media and newspapers detailing the donation creates good will within the community. Maintaining a positive relationship with the community has the intent of ultimately driving sales for the company. Products and services are not always mutually exclusive. Innovative companies learn to bundle products and services to diversify and strengthen their income statements. Examples of product and service bundles include software packages with technical support contracts or salons that sell their own cosmetic products. For these businesses, products and services can often be effectively marketed together. Despite the similarity of products and services in marketing efforts, there are some differences in how consumers directly relate to each. Services tend to be more interactive and personal since the end user is often directly interacting with the service provider, whereas products are ordered online or picked off a shelf without any personal interaction taking place. Consumers can also customize their service experience by stating preferences. Products, however, are mass produced and do not often offer customers the opportunity to give input. For this reason, service marketing needs to allow for the human component, marketing the person in addition to the service. Arke.com: Marketing Services vs. Products: Is There a Difference?

Covid 19: How Safe is the Stock Island Homeless Shelter? What More Can be Done? KOTS sleeping arrangements before COVID-19 So far, the Florida Keys have had 40 people test positive for Covid-19. Thursday saw the first local death from the virus, a Key West man who was only 55-year-old. Among the particularly vulnerable are those who live in senior citizen group homes and the local homeless shelter. There are approximately 119 people living at the Stock Island homeless shelter (KOTS). What if one of them contracts the virus in town, comes back that night to eat dinner, watch tv, and sleep, all in very close quarters with the other "clients" assisted every night at the shelter? In all probability he (or she) would infect a very large number of his brethren who, in turn, would go back to town the next morning to work, as many do, or simply to stroll the streets. The dangers created by this situation are obvious. According to the 2019 Homeless Population Point in Time Survey the Keys has a population of about 500 homeless people on a given night with 190 of them living in various emergency shelters. If the virus was to spread through this very vulnerable population and 20% of them needed hospitalization those additional people, all getting sick more or less simultaneously, could contribute to maxing out the Keys' hospital capacity. And once infected, the homeless population could also contribute to spreading the virus. When we asked Key West Mayor, Teri Johnston, a week ago, about the clustered conditions at the shelter she told us she was working with Sheriff Rick Ramsay to add more ground, along with some tents that could be used to add distance between beds. We were able to verify today that this has been done. Two military-style tents have been set up, so beds are now at least 6 feet apart. But the situation is far from perfect, according to Michael Riley, who works at the KOTS homeless shelter. "I can't really keep people from sitting together to watch TV or from gathering together if they want to." There's only one television at KOTS and every night it plays from a stock of donated VHS tapes and DVD's. When we were last at KOTS (before Covid-19) we witnessed between 20 and 30 people crammed together after dinner to watch Sylvester Stallone be "Rambo." Elicia Pintabona, the Executive Director who runs KOTS for the City, through the Southernmost Homeless Assistance League (SHAL), said that much has been done at KOTS to respond to the Covid-19 health crisis. "KOTS just put new measures in place to ensure clients are social distancing appropriately. If they can't or won't take the precautions, they simply can't stay," said Elicia. Additionally, every KOTS client must now wash hands before being admitted, clients are sleeping "head to toe," and the city has provided hand washing and sanitizing stations. "We have instituted a once a day only policy regarding coming and going. We found that clients were leaving and coming back multiple times a day. This increased the risk and vulnerability of the facility, so we've limited that to once a day. And again they must wash their hands upon entrance." The shelter is now open 24 hours a day in an attempt to keep the homeless safely sheltered "at home." SHAL provides breakfast and has teamed up with the SOS community kitchen which is now providing daily lunches. St. Mary's Soup Kitchen is providing dinner, as it has for years. However, when it comes to Covid-19, some key concerns remain. Elicia says the shelter currently has enough face masks for its staff and clients. However, when we asked people on the ground, they said KOTS' clients are not wearing the masks. While the CDC's Covid-19 guidance up until today told members of the public to wear a face mask only if they are sick, today that guidance changed. CDC is now recommending that everyone "wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain." In Asia, the ubiquitous use of masks is credited as an essential part of how Hong Kong manages to stay relatively open, including restaurants, while keeping the epidemic in check. (Masks of infected people will block the virus. Since the virus can be spread by people who do not yet know they are infected, everyone should wear a mask, thereby protecting others.) Wearing mask at KOTS would protect the group from rapid contamination. Alicia agrees, "We actually just requested a large quantity of masks from a local sewing group and also from the City's Emergency Management Liaison in order to stay ahead of the demand." But the shelter does have a "wish list" of items that would help make KOTS even safer: The shelter needs at least one 'no-contact thermometer' to test people's temperature at the door. Two or three more televisions with DVD capacity would help divide the people into smaller groups every night. And Liquid Hand Soap is high on the list. Elicia told us KOTS has long been using 25 cases of bleach a month, under normal conditions, to keep KOTS clean but is now additionally using hospital virucide disinfectant to disinfect the shelter twice a day. She said they are also waiting for an additional stock of virucide foggers and spray foggers in addition of the ones the shelter has been using. And Elicia is also hoping to get some of those 5-minute Covid-19 testers we've all been hearing about as soon as possible. Florida Keys residents have always had mixed feelings about the local homeless population; however, it is clearly in everyone's best interests to assist the shelter in every possible way. People can also donate to the shelter directly by clicking on the donate button on the home page of SHAL's website.

Cairo, Egypt | LOUIS JADWONG | If Uganda Cranes deny the Egyptian Pharaohs maximum points Tuesday night, they will be within reach of the "Promised Land" of World Cup Russia 2018. After stand-in coach Moses Basena said he was the Biblical Moses, ready to lead his team to Canaan, the Uganda Cranes team dared to dream, and by the final whistle on Thursday, had beaten Egypt's Pharaohs 1-0 to top World Cup qualifying Group E. It was Uganda's first victory over the Egyptians since 1965, and in biblical terms, can be equated to Moses parting the waters of the Red Sea for the Israelites to cross. "I'm the Moses to lead Cranes to the Promised Land" said Basena early last week. Reaching the Promised Land as the Israelites discovered, was fraught with difficulties. That is what Cranes face at Alexandria's Borg El Arab stadium from 9pm. In African football terms, no task is as big as playing the Egyptian Pharaohs at their own home-ground. Uganda -Egypt battles have been far between, and have mainly been friendlies but still always ended with the Pharoahs winning. Since their first meeting in 1962, a Nations Cup match that Egypt won 2-1 in Ethiopia, Uganda has faced their North African opponents 17 other times, with nine of those being friendlies. Egypt have won 13 of those, lost only two (1965 and 2017) and drawn 3. The last time Uganda visited Egypt in a competitive match was in 1995, a Nations Cup qualifying match that the Pharaohs won 6-0. "We picked up a good result against Egypt. We need to build on that. It is this group that will do the job," said Basena, flanked by Ibra Sekagya and goalkeeping coach Fred Kajoba, at one of the team's last briefings in Egypt. Basena will hope the experience of many of his players who have faced Egyptian opposition in the past year will count in this key World Cup Africa zone qualifying group match. The stadium is the same venue where goalkeeper Denis Onyango lifted the CAF Champions League with South African side Mamelodi Sundowns in 2016. The likes of striker Derrick Nsibambi helped KCCA beat Egyptian side Al Masry in April. "I know the stadium very well. It will be my second time here but I have great memories on this ground. I hope we can enjoy more great memories as Uganda Cranes on Tuesday" said Onyango on Monday. Basena has travelled with the entire XI that started against Egypt last Thursday, including livewire Emmanuel Okwi who scored the only goal, and Farouk Miya who has shaken off an injury. Egypt's 44-year-old goalkeeper Essam El Hadary is a doubt for the game but Liverpool striker Mohamed Salah will get a second chance after some missed chances in Kampala, and will be the main threat. The other strike options Argentine coach Hector Cuper will have are Arsenal midfielder Mohamed Elneny and City winger Ramadan Sobhy. Egypt have not been to the World Cup since 1990 and anything other than a win Tuesday will put Cuper under immense pressure. Uganda has not been to the World Cup before. Defeat will not completely rule out their hopes, but will raise fears again that the best they can achieve is to get near the promised land, but like the Biblical Israelites, still need a Joshua to go all the way.

The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) campaign group has welcomed commitments by signatories of the Montreal Protocol to tackle concerns over high levels of emissions containing the ozone depleting substance CFC11. The conclusion of the latest meeting of parties singed up to the Montreal Protocol in Ecuador last week set out new steps to understand the source of the CFC11 emissions that an EIA investigation attributed to a number of factories in China. The campaign group said it welcomed the reaction to an investigation it had undertaken into "widespread and pervasive" use of CFC-11 for construction purposes in China. It argues the investigation has raised important questions over the wider effectiveness of existing monitoring and enforcement of greenhouse gas emissions. Information will now be required during the next meeting of the parties concerning CFC11 levels in the atmosphere and an analysis of existing monitoring work and reporting on the substance as part of the protocol, according to the EIA. EIA UK climate campaigns leader Clare Perry said the organisation commended China over its stated commitments for trying to tackle illegal production of CFC11. However, she said that the latest commitments from the Chinese and other parties signed up to the Montreal Protocol still faced significant challenges. The campaign group added that all signatories had agreed during the meeting to introduce provisions for reporting details around HFCs under the Kigali Amendment to the protocol. This will take effect in January 2019. Agreement was also reached during the meeting to consider making use of a financial mechanism under the protocol to provide extra funding for energy efficiency initiatives in low volume consuming countries, the EIA added. Avipsa Mahapatra, who leads the EIA's US climate campaign, said that China's response to enforcing CFC11 production on the back of its campaigning reflected the importance of the Montreal Protocol.

Group Of Tulsa Business Owners File Lawsuit Against Mayor Bynum, City Council Over Mask Mandate Tuesday, August 18th 2020, 12:17 pm TULSA, Okla. - Some local doctors and citizens are suing Tulsa's Mayor over the mask mandate. The lawsuit includes Tulsa Health Department and city councilors, saying the masks can make people sick and the mandate should be lifted. One of the things the lawsuit said is that people are not wearing masks properly and could be causing more harm by spreading bacteria on the masks each time they are used. "Lots of people have respiratory diseases and disabilities and genetic changes that make wearing a mask uncomfortable inducing anxiety, dizziness, brain fog, etc. and we have to understand that and we need to allow those people with those disabilities to make a decision for themselves," said Dr. Jim Meehan, MD. Dr. Meehan along with several Tulsa business owners filed the lawsuit. Back in July when the mask mandate passed, Mayor G.T. Bynum said it was the right decision based on the advice of health experts. "We're hearing from doctors from around the state that something like this should be put in place. We're hearing from the superintendents of all three of our school districts now that we need this in place," said Mayor Bynum. The lawsuit said the mask mandate puts the burden of enforcing the ordinance on business owners, which puts them at risk for a potential lawsuit. "They were made to be enforcers of the city ordinance. So when an employer is forced to enforce a mask mandate in their employees and they are also violating OSHA occupational safety and health administration regulations that's a set up for a real problem," said Dr. Meehan. News On 6 reached out to Mayor Bynum's office, Tulsa City Councilors, and Tulsa Health Department for a comment, but they said they cannot comment at this time since this is ongoing litigation.

"For years, people have been asking those of us who study cooperation about the motive that is behind an action," said Harvard Professor Martin Nowak. Nowak (from right), Moshe Hoffman, and Erez Yoeli have developed a first-of-its-kind model, dubbed the "envelope game," that can help researchers to understand not only why humans evolved to be cooperative but why they evolved to cooperate in a principled way. Aside from the obvious, what is it that distinguishes Mother Teresa from Sean Penn? Both performed charitable acts. Mother Teresa worked for decades in the slums of Calcutta, and Penn was among those who traveled to New Orleans to help victims of Hurricane Katrina. But while the late Mother Teresa is today recognized as a near saint, Penn was widely mocked for bringing an entourage — including a publicist and a personal photographer — to document the aid effort. Martin Nowak, professor of mathematics and biology and director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics (PED), Moshe Hoffman, a research scientist at PED, and Erez Yoeli, a visiting scholar at PED and a researcher at the Federal Trade Commission, might argue that the difference between the two could be chalked up to what the public perceives as contrasts in motivation. While Mother Teresa's efforts were seen as purely altruistic, Penn's actions suggested his aid might amount to little more than a publicity stunt. To understand why it matters to people what Mother Teresa's motives were, Nowak, Hoffman, and Yoeli have developed a first-of-its-kind model, dubbed the "envelope game," that can help researchers to understand not only how cooperation evolved, but why people care so much about others' motives. The model is described in a paper recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The solution, Hoffman explained, was to add a new wrinkle to the traditional "cooperation game" used by researchers, one that offers players the chance to consider the costs of cooperation. As outlined by Nowak, Hoffman, and Yoeli, the game works this way: Before deciding whether to cooperate, one player has the option of opening an envelope telling him or her whether the cost of cooperation is high or low. Based on that information, that player can choose whether to cooperate or not, and the second player — who knows whether the counterpart looked in the envelope — can then decide whether to repeat the interaction, with a new envelope, or end the relationship. The model can also help to explain why a New Orleans rescue mission ultimately became fodder for criticism. That's not to suggest, Nowak said, that that sort of cooperation is bad. That analysis, Hoffman said, revealed the conditions under which people are more likely to trust those who do not open the envelope — that is, those who are true altruists — more than those who do. Since authentic altruists, he continued, never look in the envelope, they cooperate regardless of the cost. Understanding how motives affect cooperation, Hoffman said, is more than just an academic exercise. The model described in the paper also offers insights into a host of real-world situations ranging from politics to the boardroom and beyond, clarifying when people should care about motives as well as whether policymakers should respect these considerations. The new model could also be applied to the business world, Yoeli said, where managers could benefit from demonstrating their principles to employees. Yoeli adds that the model suggests when people should care if businesses are principled: when the firm's temptation to misuse personal data or reduce the quality of their products varies considerably over time, and users will have already given up their sensitive information or be locked into the firm's products. The model sheds light onto laws banning practices such as prostitution or selling organs. According to Yoeli, this model suggests that laws banning the sale of organs enables policymakers or voters to signal their trustworthiness at the cost to those who are in need of a kidney. Most importantly, the authors hope, this model can bring principled behavior and authentic altruism out of the domain of philosophy and theology and provide an evolutionary explanation for such phenomena.

As the technology and economic is developing, the environment problem is becoming a severe problem, and the people are seriously affected. The sustained damage to the environment has caused a serious problem, such as air pollution, sand storm, extraordinary weather, and diseases etc., people suffer from what they have done to the environment. However. People have realized that it will be too late if they don't do anything to prevent things from getting worse. For example, there is an "Earth Hour" on a Saturday of March of each year. It is a global movement, usually it lasts from 8:30pm to 9:30pm. It is also called "Light-off for One Hour". During this hour, all the light will be turned off. The purpose of this movement is not only to save energy, but also to warn the people to realize the importance of protecting the mother earth, and to stop violating the environment. Anyway, people and the environment have to keep a balance relationship. People take from the environment, and have to protect it too. Shen Xing moved to study diligently, just to see Shen Sihai to the accounts to check in advance. He saw the meaning of his father, as if do not want to continue cooperation with Dominique, and thought his proposal has finally worked. At the time of Shen Sihai's visit, Du Mingli brought good news. After the incident was over, under the invitation of Beller, the empress dowager and emperor allowed Shen Xing to escalate to any of them. Even after all the Shen family business, Beller must invest in stocks. Although Shen Sihai think this connection is worth 30% of shares, but still was out of Dominic Wu's move impressed. He knew that with this booklet, Jingyang all business will be attributed to its own. Du Mingli again spoke of the people who were dismissed last time were dismissed, the adults of the Ministry of Punishment were sent back to the country, and even Zhao Baishi was reduced from four to seven. Shen Sihai Beller's strength more confidence, could not help but be happy.

I did genetic tests with a very famous genomics company, and they gave me a 14-megabyte document full of genetic code which I could not decipher by myself. The test taken by Ran's child cost 6,500 yuan ($940) and was developed by DaAn Gene, a Guangzhou-based genomics company that only began offering personal genetic testing products in 2015. Affiliated with Sun Yat-sen University, DaAn had been focusing on research-related gene studies and working with institutions. It was only in the past two years that it started targeting members of the public as customers. In China, there are over 150 genomics firms. Currently, 70 percent of them mainly offer gene-testing services, and an increasing number of them have started to offer tests to individual consumers. With attractive advertisements and mysteriously advanced technology, genomics firms have become attractive choices for investors. A rough calculation by CN Healthcare says that 40 Chinese gene companies received investment in 2016, worth over 80 billion yuan in total. According to the National Human Genome Research Institute in the U.S., genome sequencing costs started to fall sharply in 2007, when the cost per genome was around $10 million. By 2015, that number had dropped to less than $1,000. As these businesses increasingly target the public, two types of gene companies have emerged: On one side, there are the traditional gene technology companies that entered the market before 2012; on the other side are the startups targeting individual customers and promoting the commercial use of genomics. But at the same time, there are also companies like DaAn Gene that cover both professional and personal tests. "As a leading company in the genomics industry, it's our responsibility to help more people learn about gene studies, with lower prices and from a simpler angle," a spokesperson at DaAn Gene told Chinese business newspaper 21st Century in 2015. China has strict rules for public hospitals hoping to distribute gene products developed by private companies: An official approval from the China Food and Drug Administration is needed, but in a general sense, the official attitude appears to favor the wider use of gene technology in medical fields. In 2015, the Chinese health ministry for the first time allowed 107 hospitals to conduct non-invasive prenatal tests (NIPTs). One year later, the ban was lifted, and all hospitals with an obstetrics department could do the test. Worldwide, DNA-based tests are available for over 1,500 diseases in people of all ages, yet so far in China, the NIPT, which costs about 2,000 yuan per test, is the most common and screens for three kinds of genetic disease. Although the government has allowed nearly all hospitals to conduct NIPTs, these tests which involve widely accepted science, still aren't a direction many startup companies plan to specialize in. This is largely because two companies, Berry Genomics and BGI, basically dominate the NIPT service market, leaving slim opportunities for newcomers. If a parent forces their child whose genes showed athletic ability to play sports even though the child prefers piano, there are obvious ethical problems. Zheng Hongkun founded Biomarker Technologies in 2009 after working at BGI for nine years. With an estimated market value of 1 billion yuan, his company develops sequencing technologies and provides data and sequencing services for research institutes. Zheng says Biomarker will put more effort into developing genetic applications for early tumor detection and more precise medical treatment. "Apart from reproductive health, tumors are the other area in which genomics can play an important role," he adds. After doing two genetic tests, Huang Jinzhang, the former editor-in-chief of Phoenix Weekly, decided to start his own genomics company, Gese DNA, which focuses on providing "readable content." The aim is to present information in a straightforward way, without technical jargon or figures. "I did genetic tests twice in 2013 with a very famous, very professional genomics company, and they gave me a report: a 14-megabyte document full of genetic code which I could not decipher by myself," Huang told China Newsweek magazine in December 2016. Afterward, he decided to develop a more user-friendly alternative. The package offered by Gese DNA, which costs 499 yuan, claims to answer questions relating to six aspects of health and character — for example, how fast you can learn new things, whether you're easily addicted to something, or if you have an introverted personality. If you're a man, it can even tell you the probability that you'll go bald. Compared to medical uses like NIPT and tumor treatment, personal genetic tests, which purport to answer people's questions about their health, lifestyle, and personality, tend to be more explicit, have less scientific backing, and be less regulated. On Taobao, China's largest online e-commerce platform, there are clear rules banning the sale of these genetic products, although gene-testing packages, ranging in price from 99 to 2,999 yuan, can still be found at over 40 stores. Most of these target parents who want to find out more about their children's talents. Though recognized by many people and favored by startups and venture capitalists, genetic tests remain controversial. "If a parent forces their child whose genes showed athletic ability to play sports even though the child prefers piano, or if an employer wants to see the test results, there are obvious ethical problems," says Huang Shangzhi, a professor at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing. But ethical issues and accuracy are not primary concerns for many businesspeople. WeGene, another personal genetics company, not only generates talent reports, but also gives health resolution packages that include advice on losing weight or curing insomnia. Once you part with your genetic information, there can't be guarantees of privacy and anonymity. Selling health solutions to consumers is a common business model applied by companies, but there is also another approach: data collection. California-based 23andMe has become a role model for many Chinese genomics companies. Initially a personal genetics startup, 23andMe has now become a research company that partners with drug developers and medical institutions. In 2015, it announced a deal with Pfizer, giving the giant drugmaker access to data it collected from 650,000 individuals. Will 23andMe's Chinese acolytes follow a similar path to monetization by selling data? Cheng says that companies like Gese DNA and WeGene can certainly accumulate a lot of data, which is a core component for genetic research. Personal genetic testing startups can see a path to becoming data-oriented research companies, provided they can get enough private data and permission to use it. Alternatively, they can try to develop their medical teams, becoming more service-oriented by partnering with hospitals and medical institutions to offer health solutions. The qualifications to decode genes could be a determining factor for startups, Professor Huang says. For talent tests, accuracy might not be vital, but medical treatment is different — and Huang says China lacks trained genetic consultants. "The genetic test results are useful tools for clinical diagnosis and treatment, but only people with both genetic knowledge and clinical experience can make sense of the data," he says, adding that only an estimated 5 percent of doctors in China are qualified to do this.

This is a software issue that has been bugging me these past few weeks. I put my computer to sleep, I wake it up, and everything boots up but the backlight. The problem is not hardware because the light does come on eventually. Problem is, that this issue is not reproducible, but it most likely happens when the laptop is not attached to the AC. Now the only reason I'm posting about this issue now, is that I've rebooted my A1211 many times and the backlight is still stubbornly off. It may turn on again eventually, but at this point, I don't know. Here's what I've found online. If anyone can add more to this issue, please do. Start it up in "Safe Mode" by holding down the "Shift key". This failing boot from the system installation disk by inserting the disk and restarting holding down the "C" key. If the problem persists, then it's a hardware issue. While using my friend's monitor, the backlights magically turn back on again! I didn't even touch the LCD, maybe the wiggling of my typing did something, but what hardware issue does that point to? I'll try your reboot method next time the lights go out. I'm hoping this is due to the software issue I posted, but so far, I really haven't come across any evidence of what the source of the problem might be. It really is a random issue. It comes and goes when it pleases. Isn't there a diagnostic test I could perform? I really don't want to jump the gun and spend money on a replacement until I'm sure it's the inverter. I agree with reMacberlin for the inverter board issue or a flaky inverter cable connection but if you want to explore the software issue boot the MBP from another source than your hard drive and check if the problem persists. If one of your friends has a Intel Mac just connect to his Mac via firewire target mode and boot your MBP from his hard drive or boot from an external firewire or USB drive. Well I am getting a firewire external HDD soon. (I can fresh install 10.6 on it right?) So unless there is another test I could perform, I'll go down that road. I found these solution on the Apple forums. Vahan C será eternamente grato(a).
Datsun Go fails crash test, dismally Industry news / 6 November 2014, 09:27am / Jason Woosey The Datsun Go's structure performed so badly that fitting an airbag would be futile, says Global NCAP. The Maruti Suzuki Swift, it was concluded, would perform better with airbags. Luckily SA models are fitted with these essential safety items. The Datsun Go recently hit South African streets with a refreshingly affordable price tag of just R89 500, yet it also came under fire for not offering basic safety features like airbags and ABS. Now it appears that airbags might not help much anyway. In a recent crash test conducted by Global NCAP's new Indian division, the Go's structure collapsed during the 64km/h frontal offset test. According to Bharat NCAP, the crash test dummy's readings "indicated a high probability of life-threatening injuries." While the lack of airbags ensured that the driver's head hit the steering wheel and dashboard, even having them on board might not have made much of a difference as the organisation also remarked that "the failure of the body shell makes fitting an airbag redundant." ZERO STARS ACROSS THE BOARD Little surprise then, that the Datsun Go received an adult occupant rating of zero stars. Bharat NCAP also announced the crash test results of the Maruti Suzuki Swift and although it also failed to gain a single star, its structure performed better in the tests. It appears that main problem here was a lack of airbags, causing the dummy's head to hit the steering wheel. The structure did show some signs of collapsing in the frontal offset crash test, however the crash testing authority concluded that "the fitting of airbags would improve occupant protection." Suzuki South Africa sources its 1.2-litre Swift models from India and thankfully our cars do have airbags fitted across the range. Providing that the structure remains relatively stable, these explosive cushions actually do appear to make a big difference. Earlier this year, Global NCAP crash tested a batch of compact hatchbacks, including the Ford Figo and VW Polo, and all of them were slapped with a zero star rating. However, the Polo was later retested with airbags, after they were made standard, and the car suddenly achieved a four-star rating. IS IT SCAREMONGERING? However, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers has dismissed the crash test reports as "scaremongering". Its director general, Vishnu Mathur, said: "Global NCAP can do what they want. We have our own safety road map that we are going to follow and are already following." Mathur accused Global NCAP of not considering that average speeds are lower in India than in more developed countries, as a result of bad roads and heavy traffic. Strange then, that these conditions have not prevented India from having one of the worst road death tolls in the world, with around 1.2 million deaths recorded in the last decade, according to Reuters. And if it's ok for cars to be less protective because of India's 'slow' roads what are the implications, then, when these cars are imported to the not-so-slow streets of South Africa? Do we even matter? THREE PILLARS OF PROTECTION The moral of the story is that a seatbelt alone is not going to stop you from striking the steering wheel during a frontal crash, although it will most certainly soften the blow of the impact and you really have to be an idiot not to wear one. But to maximise your changes, you need a seatbelt, airbag and a decent structure around you. And if you're going to Go for the Datsun, it is a rather solid and affordable car, just make sure you never have an accident. NOW WATCH THE CRASH TEST VIDEOS:
Agents Of SHIELD Season 8 Release Date And Spoilers in Web Shows by Ritika Negi December 7, 2021, 8:00 pm Marvel's Agents of SHIELD has entertained the fans in a marvelous way. Though all the fans have one question in common will there be a season 8? sadly, according to the sources chances of season 8 happening are fairly low. Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is an American television series created by Joss Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jed Whedon based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D. ABC Studios, Marvel Television, and Mutant Enemy Productions collaborated on the project. S.H.I.E.L.D was the first in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If you're wishing that the ABC series will bring it back for season 8, we're sorry to inform you that there's a slim chance that the superhero show will return in the near future for a new season of the show. Agents Of SHIELD Season 8 Release Date The cast of SHIELD thought the series would come to an with the 5th season. Even the last episode of the 5th season was titled "The End". Marvel threw in a surprise, as expected, and it was later renewed by ABC for two more seasons. While season 8 is unlikely, a possible remake could take the Agents of SHIELD storyline beyond season 7. Last May, after mentioning a number of remakes rumors that were shot down in recent months, Deadline asked Loeb and his fellow executive producer Jeffrey Bell if the series is "genuinely over" after its very last episode. Season 7 marketing consistently emphasized this as the team's final battle. It even became a major part of the plot when the Chronicom Enoch predicted the team would break up after winning the Time War. The team has split up, as evidenced by a one-year-forward scene in the season 7 finale. This means that Season 8 of Agents of SHIELD is unlikely. Agents Of SHIELD Season 8 Cast The agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. deal with a wide range of exceptional cases and enemies. Including Hydra, Life Model Decoys, Inhumans, alien species such as the Kree and Chronicoms as well as time travel. Numerous episodes have direct intersections with MCU films or other television series. Most notably Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), which had a significant impact on the series during its first season. In addition to Gregg, other actors from the MCU appear in cameo roles. The SHIELD team became embroiled in a Time War with an alien race known as the Chronicles. The expedition revealed the secret history of their platform at the Lighthouse, the history of their allies the Koenigs, and several new Barbarous menaces. It was a wise strategy, transforming Agents of SHIELD season 7 into a true "Last Gasp" for what had become Marvel's iconic TV series. ALSO READ: IS NARUTO REAL? KNOW ABOUT YOUR FAVORITE ANIME CHARACTER! The series premiered on ABC in the United States on September 24, 2013, and ended with a two-part series finale on August 12, 2020, with 136 episodes aired over seven seasons. It stars Ming-Na Wen as Melinda May, Brett Dalton as Grant Ward and Hive, Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson and Sarge. Chloe Bennet as Daisy Johnson, Elizabeth Henstridge plays the role of Jemma Simmons, and lain De Caestecker plays Leo Fitz. Nick Blood stars as Lance Hunter, Adrianne Palicki stars as Bobbi Morse, Luke Mitchell stars as Lincoln Campbell. John Hannah stars as Holden Radcliffe, Natalia Cordova-Buckley stars as Elena Rodriguez andJeff Ward stars as Deke Shaw. Agents Of SHIELD Season 8 Story Season 8 of Agents of SHIELD is complete, but that doesn't mean none of these characters will return. The timeline is clearly no longer linked to the mainstream MCU. But a mention of the Quantum Realm in the Agents of SHIELD season 7 finale was significant. It identified Agents of SHIELD as existing in the same Multiverse as the films. The multiverse might play an important role in Loki and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness Aside from a possible prequel, it's possible that some of the Agents of SHIELD characters will make the leap to the big screen. After all, a link to the Quantum Realm in the season 7 finale made it abundantly clear that the TV show and the movies are both parts of the same Multiverse. Season 7 of Marvel's Agents of SHIELD concluded on Wednesday night. If you're wishing that the ABC series will bring it back for season 8, we're sorry to inform you that there's a slim chance that the superhero show will return for another season of the show in the near future.

Every year around this time in the Berkshires, it seems like spring may have sprung. Even though it was 60 degrees out last week, we're now fully back to winter, so we will continue our winter cleaning tips and suggestions. Our family here at S&S Janitorial Services have collected a list of ways to help you clear the clutter out of last year! Tips and suggestions that will keep you ahead of your cleaning routines. We're here to help make Spring-cleaning a bit easier, especially when mother nature decides to tease us with warmer weather, only to bury us with snow the next day. We may have mentioned some of these same tips in the past, but as a professional cleaning company, we see these topics come up often. First, it's time to clean out those closets! If you want to eliminate clutter, this is an easy step. Organize your clothing and decide what is a keeper, and what to give away. Not only will this help you, but donating clothing that doesn't fit you, or that you don't wear, will help the community. The best way to tell if you can give away that favorite sweater or coat is time – if you haven't worn it in two years, it's a giveaway. The keepers? Wash, mend, or send them to the dry cleaners. Next, pair up your mittens and gloves, and stack them neatly where they can be easily found. Single ones can be thrown out, or mismatched to similar singles. Just be sure that you actually use the singles, and don't just hang on to them "just in case". Our third tip is to clean any boots and winter shoes thoroughly, and spray with a protective solution to keep them ready for the next year. If they don't fit, or you have not worn them in two winters, donate them. If you have a few pairs that need it and you have to keep; polish and clean shoes. Put them where you can readily find them, and keep them organized. The end of the year means taxes, and taxes most often means paperwork. Get your tax papers together now, if you start early, there will be plenty of time to go after missing receipts and add up deductions. If you have everything that you need, you can send your return to your accountant earlier (fi you use one) and get your refund faster. When this is done, you can avoid any last-minute roadblocks, and this will clean up some of the office clutter. You may even find that you can hire professional cleaners to assist you with some of the chores you really don't want to do your self! If you do a lot of work at home or make your living there, inevitably piles of papers, books and files can be a major eyesore. Now is the time to go through them systematically. File what needs filing, and recycle what doesn't. If you're not sure of something, ask yourself: Do I need it? Will I need it? Is there a better place for it? While you're at it, do the same with your computer and laptop. Delete old files, empty the trash, store files you want to save on disks or a hard drive, organize your desktops. If you really want to deep clean your keyboard, take a look here. Taking this time now will put the finishing touches on a clean and organized work space. You'll notice a clear difference in the way you feel, too, as studies have found a connection between stress and office clutter. If your dishes, silverware, pots, and pans tend to end up in a jumble, perhaps you have too many. Consider a more convenient storage system for frequently used pans, such as a hanging rack (or drawer) near where they're used. Pans that are used less frequently can be stored further away, or even in another room. The same can be said for dishes, or dinnerware that is saved for special occasions. You don't need your holiday platter taking up space with your daily dishware! Go through your spices and throw away any that are expired. Add to those the containers that have just a teeny bit left in the bottom. A good trick is to add a note to the label of the date you bought them, and then after six months, which is when most dried spices lose their oomph. Return them to the rack in alphabetical order, making retrieval much easier. The Clutter is almost gone – You CAN do it! Pull all those cans and boxes of food out of cupboards and reorganize them. Some things get shoved to the back over time, and you end up with multiples. Who needs three cans of baby beets? If it's still good but you really are never going to eat it, give to the food bank. If you need help, remember, we are always just a call or email away. We can provide free estimates on all of your cleaning needs, from entire office buildings to single rooms in your home. Keep coming back for our cleaning tips and suggestions for home and work!
Bundle of holding have a couple of offers up just now for Ars Magica, the magical fantasy RPG from Atlas Games. It was originally published by Lion Rampant and then by my beloved White Wolf. Indeed, it was created by Mark Rein-Hagen, who also created Vampire: The Masquerade and, with it, the World of Darkness. What a pedigree! Bundle of Holding have two bundles at the moment. One should be considered the 'core' bundle, whilst the second goes into detail on Mythic Europe. The first bundle was originally put out a few years ago and has been re-released a few times, since. The first tier of the bundle – priced at $14.95 – contains the core rulebook and a few supplements. The rulebook is really nicely put together – I have the physical copy sitting next to me as I type this! Of the supplements included in this tier, the True Lineages book and the Apprentices book are the most interesting. Apprentices lets you start out at a lower magical ability, as an apprentice or child. The True Lineages book outlines four hermetic houses, along with just more content such as magic, flaws, virtues and rules for undertaking research. The second tier of this bundle is priced on a threshold that is currently sitting at $25.78. It includes a further five books. The two Houses of Hermes books expand on the Hermetic Houses, whilst the Broken Covenant gives you a pre-made adventure to play through with your group. This tier, though not essential, does add a lot more content for you to use in your games. The first bundle is pretty solid, but it doesn't have anything new. It gives the same books that the old bundle did and so there's nothing there for those who have already bought into this game. As with the first bundle, the second tier of this offer is priced on a threshold. At the time of writing, this threshold is $27.23. As with the first tier, this one consists of four supplements, each further fleshing out the setting. I'm particularly interested in Antagonists, which gives you well-defined and developed villains for your stories, and Grogs, which helps to flesh out minor characters in your games. Whereas the first tier of this bundle is about the setting, the second is focused more on the characters who live there. Between the two tiers you've actually got a really strong, fleshed-out setting, vibrant with interesting organisations and characters. As usual, part of the proceeds of this bundle will go to a charity. In this case, some of your money will go to Doctors Without Borders – a very worthwhile cause! If you're interested in picking up one or both of these bundles, you can click here to visit the first, 'core' bundle or you can go ahead and click here to visit the second bundle, on Mythic Europe. If you do pick it up, let me know! Or if you have already played Ars Magica, also let me know, as I've got my copy here, but have not been able to play it yet. Would love to hear about the experiences of others.
You need to do both the shooting plan and the exercise plan to be an Archery Athlete! Below are examples of exercise plans for each skill level.

Budapest Forum questions efficiency of international human rights frameworks news | Published on 27 Nov 2018 27 Nov 2018 11th Budapest Human Rights Forum highlights global religious persecution Sharp increase in violations of religious freedom worldwide BUDAPEST (27 November 2018) – From 27 to 28 November, the 11th Budapest Human Rights Forum is taking place in the Hungarian capital. Recognizing the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the event focuses on current human rights violations across the globe. The two-day conference is dedicating one of its three panel discussions to the protection of religious minorities and freedom of religion. Amongst the speakers are Fernand de Varennes, UN Special Rapporteur for Minority Issues, Tristan Azbej, Hungarian Secretary of State for the Aid of Persecuted Christians, and Paul Coleman, Executive Director of ADF International. "No-one should be persecuted because of their faith. Beginning with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the international community has woven freedom of religion into the fabric of international law and freedom of religion is now recognized almost universally. At the same time, we see the persecution of religious minorities on the rise across the globe. The recent treatment of Asia Bibi serves as a telling example, though there are sadly countless others," said Paul Coleman, who will address the current state of religious freedom across the globe at the Forum. Religious freedom in particular need of protection The conference highlights some of the attacks on religious freedom worldwide and calls for greater action by the international community. The Forum will address issues such as the role of education in the protection and promotion of human rights, increasing the efficiency of the UN Human Rights Council, and the protection of religious minorities. "As we move forward in protecting the rights of religious minorities, we must recognize that unjust laws preventing the free exercise of religion, must be repealed or modified. Those countries most dedicated to being beacons for religious freedom must lead the way," said Coleman. ADF International is commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration with the I'm Human, Right? campaign and The Geneva Statement. Supported by tens of thousands of signatures the campaign urges the international community to uphold the fundamental right to life, family, and religious freedom, as recognized by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

William Carey cheerleader drains an unbelievable back-flip bomb. Give William Carey University cheerleader Ashley Arnau credit. What many skeptics initially suspected was a cleverly doctored viral ad campaign—for Coke, maybe?—is, apparently, the real thing. Arnau has reportedly attempted the stunt at every WCU home game for the past two months. Last night, she finally sunk it.
Q: Migrating an ASP.NET app to Java I'm trying to migrate a small ASP.NET MVC 2 app to Java on Tomcat 6. I know the basics of JSPs and servlets. I don't know any MVC Java web framework. So I'm trying to determine how to proceed in a way that will keep the migration effort to a minimum. I know I'll have to rewrite the app in Java but how do I map ASP.NET concepts to Java world? What Java web framework should I choose given my lack of experience and my deadline of 4 weeks from now? What's the most agile way to go about this? Note that I can't use Grails or JRuby or anything like that. This port must be done using standard Java web frameworks. I also won't have admin access on the production Tomcat server that this will eventually deployed to. Are there any migration guide that would be useful? Among other things, I need to understand how best to rewrite the security [current using ASP.NET profiles] and database access [currently using LINQ]. A: Why "This port must be done using standard Java web frameworks"? Is it your boss' requirement? If really so then it looks like you have not much choice. Strictly speaking a "standard" framework is the one supported by Oracle. Below is what I found on oracle site: http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnadp.html It looks like currently only JSF is mentioned and thus recommended. I recall more technologies were recommended before? * *The Java EE 6 Tutorial Part II The Web Tier Part II * *Chapter 3, Getting Started with Web Applications *Chapter 4, JavaServer Faces Technology *Chapter 5, Introduction to Facelets *Chapter 6, Expression Language *Chapter 7, Using JavaServer Faces Technology in Web Pages *Chapter 8, Using Converters, Listeners, and Validators *Chapter 9, Developing with JavaServer Faces Technology *Chapter 10, Java Servlet Technology A: As far as I know, Scooter framework is a rapid web application development framework which just requires developers to know basic JSP/Servlet and MVC concepts. Since your deadline is only 4 weeks away, you can try it. It comes with many examples. See the Hello World example and Blog example. The downside is it may not support LINQ. It does support Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL.

Bond Revoked in Miami Health Care Fraud Case Bond Revocation, Health Care Fraud, Medicare Fraud June 16, 2022 December 20, 2022 palmbeachfederaldefense A South Florida man awaiting trial for allegedly submitting more than $4 million in fraudulent health-care claims was detained on a jet ski as he tried to escape to Cuba, according to a press release from the Department of Justice. U.S. Coast Guard officers found the man on a broken-down jet ski in the Florida Keys along. Another man known to law enforcement for smuggling illegal aliens was aboard the jet ski along with him. "The jet ski was outfitted with a special fuel cell to allow for long trips, and within the compartments of the jet ski, law enforcement discovered a trove of food and water bottles," officials said. According to allegations in the criminal complaint, the man owned a Florida corporation which purported to provide durable medical equipment ("DME") to eligible Medicare beneficiaries. The complaint alleges that the man, in only a two-month period in 2022, submitted approximately $4.2 million in fraudulent health care claims to Medicare for DME that he never provided, and that Medicare beneficiaries never requested. As a result, Medicare paid the man over $2.1 million. A judge agreed with prosecutors that the man posed a flight risk and should not be given a bond. Officers also confiscated his passport. He will remain at the Federal Detention Center in Miami until his trial. How is Crypto Fraud Investigated and Prosecuted? 15 Charged in Prescription Drug Fraud Scheme
Handling a terminal cancer diagnosis There's no set playbook for how to handle a terminal cancer diagnosis. "The sky's the limit," said Dr. Erin Costanzo, a psychologist with the UW Carbone Cancer Center Health Psychology Clinic. "Pretty much any feeling is normal." There's pain. Fear. Anger. Sadness. Or, she said, for many people the news might not sink in right away. It's an overwhelming situation, and it's normal to feel numb to it right away. "Often it takes some time for that information to settle in, for people to connect to it," she said. "I've certainly talked with many patients over the years who are very capable of understanding what their doctors are saying, but that information about a difficult prognosis just doesn't set in until later." These reactions can be complicated and will differ from person to person. It can be especially tricky if loved ones have different reactions and emotions about the diagnosis. Costanzo said while a patient may be in shock and not have any emotional response immediately, a spouse may have a strong, immediate reaction. Costanzo said it's OK to be in different places about the news, and she suggested having open conversations about how each other feels without trying to "fix" or change the other's thinking. "The most important thing is to be a good listener and ask curious questions," she said. "Focus on getting concerns and feelings and thoughts out there without trying to quickly move into, 'What should we do about this?' mode." Costanzo also said it can be easy for a loved one or caregiver to push their own feelings aside. The opposite also can be true. "Often patients will say, 'This is awful, but I can be OK with this. I'm really worried about my spouse, or my child, or somebody else very close,'" she said. "Everybody needs to remember to make space for their own emotions." Costanzo recommends "The Complete Bedside Companion: A No-Nonsense Guide to Caring for the Seriously Ill" as a helpful book for loved ones who are serving as caregivers. The Carbone Cancer Center Health Psychology Clinic provides consultations and brief treatment to patients who would like help coping with cancer, treatment, and prognosis. In addition to helping address difficult emotions and thoughts, Costanzo said staff can also help with strategies for patients having trouble sleeping, who are fatigued or who have treatment-related pain. Carbone's Palliative Care Team is a useful resource for patients, offering medical care focused on quality of life and pain management as well as spiritual resources and social worker support. Costanzo also highly recommends that patients who may have weeks or months left to live reach out to their local hospice provider. Those agencies not only care for patients but also offer helpful support services for families. Figuring out how to tell others about a terminal diagnosis can be difficult. Costanzo said patients should take time to focus on themselves and ask questions of their physician. That creates a wiser space to decide on how they would like to share information and with whom they would like to share it. "One of the things that patients worry about is that people may treat them differently when they hear they have a poor prognosis," she said. "I usually advocate for letting people close to you in your inner circle know, but beyond that, it's really up to the patient how much they want to share and with whom." Discussing the topic with children can be daunting. Costanzo recommends the book, "How to Help Children Through a Parent's Serous Illness: Supportive, Practical Advice from a Leading Child Life Specialist," as a resource with age-appropriate advice. Costanzo said some patients find comfort in creating legacy gifts for children, such as a stuffed animal with a recording of a loved one's voice, or video and audio recordings for special occasions in the future. Once they have had some time to process news about a difficult prognosis, Costanzo said it is common to think about what to do with their time left. Should they create a "bucket list" of big events to achieve? For some, she said, making lists like that can be helpful and give fulfillment. But it is also common to continue in normal routines and daily activities for as long as possible, including continuing to work. She advised that patients pursue whatever activities best reflect their values and priorities — there is no obligation to do things a certain way. "For many people, it may be a hybrid or compromise," she said. "Maybe you do something you've been putting off, like a trip or a family reunion, and continue with the daily activities and routines that can also provide a sense of comfort and meaning. "There's no right or wrong answer." Costanzo added that it is normal for special moments to bring complex emotions: Joy at spending time with friends and loved ones, but also grief over an event that could be "the last" one for them. "While it is normal and understandable to think 'I don't want to have hard, difficult emotions like fear and sadness,' if you don't make room for them, you may also block out other emotional experiences like joy, connectedness, and gratitude," she said. "It's very normal have a wide range of these emotions that change or shift or even occur all at once."

The Power of Dowsing The power of dowsing mystifies, attracts or goes unnoticed. Which describes you? Those who are interested in psychic powers or tools for change may be drawn to dowsing. Others may find it confusing or out of reach. But the majority of people don't even notice the power of dowsing. This includes dowsers themselves. Why Can't We All Embrace The Power of Dowsing? Why is dowsing not seen as practically a superpower that can change your life dramatically? Because unless you have the intention of improving your life, you won't notice when the Universe presents you with a simple, affordable and natural tool. At best, most dowsers use dowsing infrequently for a few situations, like testing their supplements or predicting the future. Do we underuse dowsing because we lack the intelligence or imagination to recognize its power? I don't think so. I think our energies determine how we respond to dowsing. Dowsing is a very empowering natural intuitive tool for making your life easier, healthier and happier. But if you don't want those things or if you focus instead on how disempowered and vicitmized you are, you won't even see the opportunity dowsing presents. If you have poverty mentality or a sense of not being good enough, dowsing will slip by you, because you don't resonate with its potential as a natural, affordable tool for creating the life you want. How Can You Embrace The Power? You'll need to shift or transform energies like the following: Poverty mentality Beliefs that involve negativity It is possible to change your energies and your outlook using any number of tools. We often recommend meditation (click here for our favorite free meditations), yoga nidra, guided visualization, EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) and other energy practices to create a more harmonious, empowered state of being. These methods are cheap and easy to learn and practice, and they will help you recognize the power of dowsing as a creative tool. How Can Dowsing Be Powerful? You could ask, why is dowsing so powerful? Isn't dowsing simply a tool for getting answers to questions? That's true. But if you master dowsing and use it, you become vastly more intelligent than when you only use your brain for charting a course through life. Having the answers is one of the most powerful gifts you can give yourself. In addition, dowsing technique, meaning learning all the steps to proper dowsing, is a transformational experience. You can't be fearful and dowse accurately. Seeing yourself as a victim blocks good answers to your questions. Also, it's vital to have a calm center to tap into your dowsing state. All of these skills are easy to learn and will transform you to a victor. Dowsing has been the most empowering tool of the very many we have mastered in the past twenty years. It has helped us to become conscious co-creators of the life we want to live. How has dowsing empowered you?

We look forward to answering any questions you have. Peter Foxx on August 5, 2020 at 6:47 pm Yes it is so important to have the right answers, especially the right answers for as an individual. There are so many answers out there via OP opinions etc. Asking questions and getting my answers are now part of my internal dialogue. It took time and some clearing of old patterns but boy was it worth it. You guys played a major role in that so thank you. Thanks for the kind words! We look forward to continuing to support you on your dowsing journey. Thanks Maggie. I bought new dowsing rods recently and only the right hand one moved- the left one only moved when I asked questions about direction. I had more consistency with a little pendulum so have ordered a small pendulum. Interestingly, my 11 year old daughter picked them up, asked what 'yes' was, got a very clear answer, and then started chatting away with yes/no questions. She asked "Are you a loving spirit guide?" and got a yes and a bit later, after some more questions, told me "I have a 35 year old female spirit guide who's a relative on my side of the family. We (not just me any more!) are very new to this. Does all that seem normal ? I promise not to pester you with questions!! Thanks, Greg (and Eve!)

The Florida Strawberry Growers Association represents over 75 grower members farming over 10,000 acres of strawberries in Florida with the majority being in the Plant City-Dover area. In addition, FSGA offers associate memberships to allied industries that would like to join our vast network. FSGA is a voluntary organization that represents the majority of Florida strawberry growers as members. Growers pay $50.00 per planted acre as dues. The Association represents growers on a wide variety of issues and policies, works to increase consumption and helps keep strawberry production profitable in Florida. Member Service has always been a top priority for the Florida Strawberry Growers Association. FSGA is leading the fight to reduce and streamline regulations and eliminate duplication. FSGA representatives have served on the Planning Commission, Greenway's Task Force, and the Agricultural Task Force. Currently, FSGA holds positions on the Agricultural Economic Development Council and Southwest Florida Water Management District Agricultural Advisory Committee. Issues include land use and funding for migrant housing, Greenbelt issues, open space, upland habitat, wetlands, environmental regulations and property rights. The Association has been in the forefront during every crisis over the past decades, representing growers during drought, hail, floods and freezes. Whenever growers need to provide input to governmental agencies, FSGA serves as the industry's mediator. Our Associate Membership consists of 5 levels and the dues are payable annually. Our associate members receive various benefits throughout the year based on the level of membership that they choose. According to our Bylaws we cannot publish our grower addresses. However, one of the perks that our Associate Members have found to be very beneficial is our mail-out service. Any member can prepare a mail-out that they would like to send to our growers (stuff it, seal it, and stamp it), and send it to us. We will attach address labels and deposit in the mail it for them. This allows Associates to reach our growers without having access to our list. There is a $25.00 charge for this service if you are a base member. The Board of Directors are hardest working members of our organization and they do it all for free.
Youngsters across the area could win cash for their school and a camera in a national photographic competition. Two runners-up in the remaining categories will each win £500 for their school to spend on print or photographic equipment/material, as well as receive a camera worth £100. Closing date for entries is Friday, May 6, 2016. A national competition has been launched offering the snap-happy youngsters of the South West the chance to win £1,000 for their school. cartridgesave.co.uk is challenging children aged four to 11 across the country to print off and send in a photo of something that matters to them. Alongside each entry they must explain, in fewer than 100 words, why the person, event, place or object depicted is so important to them. In return a panel of judges will award the photographer of the very best entry £1,000 for their school to spend on print or photographic equipment. Two runners-up will receive £500 for their school and all three placed entrants will bag themselves a camera worth £100. In addition, the top 50 entries from across the UK will be showcased in a free-to-download-and-print photo album. This album will become a testament to the things that mattered to children in 2016, that can be printed and physically handed down to their children's children. The Generation P competition will be judged by Stuart Nicol, former head of pictures for The Daily Telegraph and group picture editor of The Press Association. As a photographer, Stuart covered major news events all over the world including the invasion of Lebanon by Israeli forces, famine in Ethiopia and Southern Sudan and the protests in Tiananmen Square. Closer to home he covered multiple royal weddings, the miners' strike, and the conflict in Northern Ireland. He will be joined by Dr Sandi Mann, a behavioural psychologist from the University of Central Lancashire, who specialises in the analysis of things that matter to people. Children can access hints and tips from Stuart Nicol and Dr Sandi Mann on what makes a good photo and how best to explain why it matters, plus full details of how to enter here. Stuart Nicol is excited about seeing the emerging talent of Britain's youngest photographer. He said: "The most amazing thing about photography, is that it allows you to steal a moment in time, a moment never to be repeated. "A printed photograph has immense power. It allows you hold onto that memory, that moment, forever. Dr Sandi Mann believes that this competition will encourage youngsters to build a very special testimony to their lives. Ian Cowley, managing director of cartridgesave.co.uk continued: "We'll never be able to 100 per cent rely on technology, so printing is the only way to guarantee that an image won't be lost.
From very small beginnings, it seems that South Korea's electronics giant LG is placing plenty of R&D cash into OLED technology, for watches, for computer screens and now for large-screen TVs. According to DisplaySearch data, the company is already enjoying a 90 per cent market share of the 400,000 large-screen units expected to be sold this year. DisplaySearch says the OLED TV market grew to 35,200 units in Q1, more than seven times greater than the 4,600 units sold in the same period last year, showing rapid growth in the premium TV market. DisplaySearch says this will grow to a staggering seven million units globally by 2019. And currently LG has this market – more or less – to itself. Neither Samsung nor Sony has yet joined the OLED market. Samsung is said to be much more cautious over large-screen OLEDs, while Panasonic abandoned a j-v with Sony for producing OLEDs. LG said last year that it had cured the very high wastage level on larger screen production (said by informed sources to be worse than 60 per cent) and was now generating positive yields of 80 per cent, and better. With these higher yields has come tumbling prices. A 55" curved screen was once strictly in football player and Russian oligarch territory as far as pricing was concerned, at some $15,000. The same unit today costs about $2,500, and the price continues to fall. LG is currently marketing what it claims is the first 'true black' OLED display. An LG executive, speaking in Australia on July 7th, said that the company expects to take around 30 per cent of the overall 4K/UHD market by 2020. LG reportedly is to open a second OLED factory later this year at a cost of some $750 million for wearables and smart phones, and is also considering a third facility. Nevertheless, not all in LG's garden is rosy. To date, according to The Economist magazine, LG has invested some $3 billion on OLED production – and has yet to see a profit.
Christine + Frank got married on a beautiful fall day in late-September at St. Francis in Medford with a reception at The Andover Country Club. Every so often, we get the chance to get to know a couple deeper than the initial phone consultation and booking and sometimes we even become good friends. Leading up to the big day I had several phone conversations with Christine about all sorts of topics and she even hooked us up with Game 6 World Series tickets and we were lucky enough to see the big win in person at Fenway. So when the day finally arrived, I couldn't wait to share in such a momentous moment in Christine + Frank's lives. Such a fun, loving couple, the day was amazing. Christine + Frank, Thank you for letting me share in your day and provide you with a one of a kind wedding video! Much love to you both and here's to years of happiness! Are All (Wedding) Photographers The Same? I hope this blog sees you well. I came across this blog post done by Andrea Joki and thought it was brilliant so I am reposting. A question I am asked frequently is why photographers charge what they do. There is such a discrepancy in prices – and those shopping purely on price alone are nearly always going to go the least expensive route. But is that the wisest decision? One phrase I hear a lot is, "it only costs 10c to make a print – so why do you charge so much?" And if the value of the image was only the print paper cost itself, that would be a valid question. But then again, a lawyer makes several thousands and all they produce is paper worth less then a penny. So why do we pay lawyers upwards of 100 euros an hour? The easy answer is that an experienced photographer – one who has spent years studying the craft, honing skills, and perfecting style, is going to give you a much better image than the beginner who is simply clicking a shutter button. If clicking the shutter is the only parameter of a professional photographer, I'd like to offer the services of my 7 year old – she takes great pictures (everyone says so!) and I'm happy to hire her out for $200 for a disk of images. She'll be happy too – she'd love a new Lego Star Wars set. But why pay $200 for my 7 year old (or a beginner photographer) when you can just have the grandparents click the button instead – and for free? I could make this post longer by summing out costs of being a photographer: VAT/taxes, insurance, business development costs, time, software, equipment, the desire to not work for free for other people ……. but really, I would think that most would recognize there are obvious costs behind owning any business. Would you really feel you were saving money if you hired a lawyer who had no formal training or education but who felt they would be good at winning lawsuits because they saw someone do it on TV? The parallel is true since many photographers are encouraged by friends and family (would you tell your best friend that the image she shot and is so proud of has a kid in dappled light and a telephone pole sticking out of his head with a white balance so off that he is practically blue?). Similarly, many photographers are not licensed business owners – so if you get charged for poor portraits, you have no recourse. I would love to charge less – and certainly my photography business isn't going to buy me a Lexus. But at the same time, it is frustrating to be legal, pay taxes, and yet lose customers to those operating illegally. Truly: professional images comprise a lot of factors – otherwise, why would you hire someone to photograph your children if you could just do it yourself? Composition, metering, focus, white balance, skin tones, light in the eyes, pose, post processing….. these are skills that take time to develop. And the difference in quality should be fairly obvious if you compare portfolios. Which always leads to the next question: "It's just the camera, right?" And that one hit kind of home for me. One day last year, my sister told me she wanted to take images of her family and have them be as good as mine – so she asked which DSLR she should buy. I answered her honestly: unless you are going to shoot in manual modes (not auto) and learn ISO, F-stop, Shutter speed, spot metering, etc, she could spend thousands and thousands and not have as good images. Good images are about using the equipment and reading the light correctly – neither of which can be obtained in AUTO by clicking a button. If you don't believe me, go ahead and spend thousands. But also be prepared to admit that it's not the camera, it is the artist BEHIND the lens, that is making the creative and beautiful portraits. And as for my sister? She bought a prosumer and not a DSLR and has been very happy since. And saved quite a bit of money in the process. One thing I really find interesting is that people will buy Coach purses, fancy flatscreen TVs, expensive toys and sets for their children, and all manner of luxury goods that have maybe a 1-2 year lifespan. But when it comes to professional portraits, which will last a lifetime, they base the decision purely on price. I'm not sure at what point children and family become less important than a fancy purse. But I can tell you that those who purchased high quality portraits have a beautiful reminder of a time that has past – and those portraits are still hanging or displayed while the purse has long since been thrown away. Sure, parents can choose to purchase inexpensive photography based solely on price. Not everyone can afford the price of a good photographer and the compromise often is quality. But I truly hope and encourage buyers to really consider what they are buying and why – and not to choose solely on price. Your memories do not have a price tag and once this moment is gone, you forever lose the chance to have hired a true professional to beautifully capture your family. Choosing the best you can afford will always be the best advice given to anyone looking for quality professional portraits. As with anything hand-made and requiring an artistic eye, those who produce quality work often charge more – it compensates for the amount of time they have spent learning and perfecting their art. Choose not based on price – but on how the photographer expresses themselves – and how that will translate into your family's portrait work. Choosing based solely on price is saying that all photographers are the same – and that really isn't true. Sure, price may not always reflect skill. That's where a buyer's judgment and comparison of portfolios come in. But it is a good bet that a lot of the cheaper photographers will disappear in a year as they realize they are actually losing money and working for nearly free. And that is also a concern because they may not have an interest in protecting or archiving your photos. Attention fellow wedding vendors / venues!

The contract for the retrofitting was signed at the end of last week with Hudong HONDHOA Shipbuilding (Group) Co., LTD. The conversion will be carried out in the Shanghai-based shipyard Huarun Dadong Dockyard Co., Ltd.
EatFeaturedNews Room International Hot Dog Day – celebrating the fast food favourite by Press Release 17 Jul 2020 ONE of the most popular fast foods after hamburgers and pizzas has to be the hot dog and, in honour of International Hot Dog which is celebrated on Wednesday, July 22, here is the history of this sausage-in-a-bun that has been around for hundreds of years. Historians believe that the origin of the wiener sausage used in hot dogs can be traced all the way back to era of the notorious Roman emperor Nero. In Roman times it was customary to starve pigs for one week before the slaughter. Nero's cook Gaius was watching over his kitchen when he realised one pig had been brought out fully roasted, but somehow not cleaned. He stuck a knife into the belly to see if the roast was edible and out popped the intestines: empty because of the starvation diet, and puffed from the heat. According to legend, Gaius got the idea to stuff the intestines with ground game meats mixed with spices and wheat and … behold … the sausage link was created. After that, the humble sausage travelled across Europe, making its way eventually to present-day Germany, where the locals took to it as their own, creating an estimated 1 500 different versions that exist today. But it's two towns that vie to be the original birthplace of the modern hot dog sausage. Frankfurt claims the frankfurter was invented there in 1484 – some 736 years ago, but the people of Vienna (Wien in German) say they are the true originators of the "wienerwurst". Photo by Tiara Aracama But whoever is correct, it's agreed that German immigrants to New York were the first to sell wieners from a pushcart in the 1860s which led to the modern-day hotdog as we know it. There are many stories of people who claim to have brought together the wiener and the bun but according to Josh Chetwynd, author of How the Hot Dog Found Its Bun, there are only two credible contenders: One story takes place in the 1880s in St Louis where hot dogs were referred to as "red hots." A vendor was selling red hots on the city streets and passed out white gloves so people who bought them wouldn't get burnt or have greasy hands. But after people began stealing the gloves, the vendor turned to his brother-in-law to help solve the problem. His brother-in-law, a baker, suggested the vendor pair a soft roll with the red hots. Voila – the complete hot dog! Another story takes place on Coney Island, involving a man named Charles Feltman, who sold sandwiches on his cart. Unable to completely fill up his cart, he decided to sell something else and wondered if red hots could be added to a bun and eaten the same way as a sandwich. The rest is hot dog history. "The noblest of all dogs is the hot-dog; it feeds the hand that bites it" ~ Lawrence J Peter But how did the sausage and bun combination get the actual name "hot dog"? No one is certain, but one theory has it that in the 1890s, the sausage and bun vendors would sell their wares outside student dorms at several major US universities and their carts became known as "dog wagons," a slang term from the popular belief that dog meat was used in making the sausages. It was not long before the students began referring to them as "hot dogs". Whatever the facts though, there is no doubt the hot dog is as popular today as it ever was. Served with lashings of ketchup and mustard it is standard fare at sporting events, children's parties and almost always on food truck menus. In South Africa, the much-loved "boerie roll" is a close relative of the hot dog and is often served with chutney, chakalaka or fried onions. But what other topping options are there for hot dogs – or "horrogs" as locals like to pronounce it. Photo by Victoria Shes Chefs from the Capsicum Culinary Studio share their favourites. Says Lungi Makiza: "I'm a lover of all things cheesy and spicy, so a mix of mozarella and gouda with jalapenos or piquant peppers is my go to topping," while Mark Coombe likes a sriracha mayo to give a little spicy kick to the hot dog. "I also like to add some fresh rocket for a peppery flavour," he says. Natasha Jooste enjoys topping her hotdog with caramelised onions and blue cheese, and for Bianca Jacobs nothing beats Mexican salsa with white cheddar cheese. "Try it and you'll never look back," she says. Whatever your preference there's no doubt that this simplest of fast foods is going to be around for a long time and enjoyed by generations to come.

Do Deer Move In The Rain? The Facts You Need To Check Out For A Great Hunt! →Do Deer Move In The Rain? The Facts You Need To Check Out For A Great Hunt! Sure, a lot of you have already hunted under the blazing heat, or even began targeting your game on tree stands and transporting guns to your boat, but have you ever attempted hunting during inclement weather? It seems difficult, especially when predicting the way your game moves during the rainy season. It has people wondering: Do deer move in the rain? Instead of just guessing and missing out on a good hunt just because of a bit of wet weather, read on to learn more about how deer move during the rain and how you can successfully have a good hunt despite these "limitations!" So, have you ever heard of deer moving under other types of weather besides the usual sunny day? Whitetail deer (or any other deer) do not have the luxury of sleeping under the roof of a cozy home with warmth and blankets. They live outdoors and are better adapted to the outdoor life as compared to us humans. They have the metabolism that can withstand cold temperatures that would usually freeze us, as well as the fur coats that keep them warm. During windy weathers, deer do not mind the light breeze. But once the wind becomes stronger, that is when they start to hide or avoid moving. This is because it's hard to detect or identify predators as it removes the scent and makes it difficult to hear predators and in what direction it's coming from. The same would go for rainy weather. A light drizzle is fine, or even a bit stronger than that. But once it's a torrential downpour, all your senses are unable to work. Just like us, humans, deer would have difficulty smelling, seeing, or even hearing predators approach. Because of this, they would avoid moving during the extremely rainy weather until it begins to subside. Deer have the ability to predict approaching storms, feeding lightly before and after minor storms or feeding heavily before and after the major storms. So, is it recommended to hunt deer during this type of weather? If it's slightly windy or simply drizzling, then that's totally fine. You'll still be able to find a few bucks or does roaming around the fields. But don't bother hoping for a sight of the game during inclement weather, as deer are seeking shelter or do not move at these times. Before you begin the hunt, make sure that you check the weather first. Being knowledgeable with when a storm is approaching will have you be able to determine if deer will be out or hiding during the day. To avoid getting sick or being uncomfortable during the rainy hunt, I recommend that you wear quality clothing, such as a hat, jacket, boots, and gloves, on top of your usual hunting gear, of course. You won't need to change your tactics during the light rain or drizzle. But once the moderate rain begins, attempt still-hunting or reverting pastures, as spot-and-stalk is effective. Use your eyes more so than your legs! Still-hunting is a great way to hunt during moderate rain. When doing so, always go for very slow movement, taking one step and stopping each time you do so. Spend time looking at your surroundings with binoculars for hunting. If there is nothing, take another step and begin glassing again. Keep your eye on the back trail as well, as there are some bucks that come in behind you. Stop against a tree or any type of cover (like a hunting blind). This makes it easier to blend in and has you lean on something. When it begins to rain heavily, I suggest that you wait it out rather than risk your life for the hunt. The drying out period is great, as this is when you find animals resuming their normal activities. Are there some of you who wish to achieve a great feat of hunting in just about any weather? Hunting during the rainy season may seem daunting at first, but once you realize that a bit of rain won't steer deer clear from the fields, you'll probably enjoy it more (and even like the breeze that goes with it!). I hope that this article answers your question: "Do deer move in the rain?" Now that you know how your game goes around the fields as you hunt, begin planning your next expedition today! If you have any questions or would like to share your tips and experiences with hunting in the rain, then comment down below. I would love to hear what you have to think.
/ Carstares, William Carstares, William Carstares or Carstairs, William, 1649–1715, Scottish statesman and Presbyterian divine. While studying theology at Utrecht, he became a friend of William of Orange (later William III of England). He was imprisoned in Edinburgh (1674–79) for alleged coauthorship of An Account of Scotland's Grievances and again imprisoned and tortured in Edinburgh (1683) as a suspect in the Rye House Plot. He returned to Holland where he was made chaplain to William of Orange. He accompanied William to England in 1688 and became so powerful in his efforts to reconcile the new king and the Scottish church and to frustrate the Episcopalian Jacobites that he was nicknamed the Cardinal. His influence continued under Queen Anne as he worked for the union of England and Scotland, served as principal of the Univ. of Edinburgh from 1703, and was four times moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland.

The Charities (Protection and Social Investment) Bill returned to the House of Lords on Tuesday 2 February for consideration of Commons amendments in 'ping pong'. What is ping-pong/consideration of amendments? Lords members discussed MPs' amendments relating to fund-raising and the powers of the Charity Commission. Members discussed subjects including the regulation of fundraising. The Bill now goes to the Commons for its consideration. Cabinet Office minister, Lord Bridges of Headley (Conservative), introduced the bill as one which would 'strengthen the public's trust in charities and help charities to do more'. He explained the majority of the proposals within the bill concern the powers of the Charity Commission. Members of the Lords offered broad support for the bill, but called for additional powers for the Charity Commission and extra responsibilities for charities to be added. Several members identified the issue of proper protection for vulnerable people and children as an area which needs more consideration as the bill progresses. Committee stage, the chance for line by line scrutiny, begins in the Lords on Tuesday 23 June. The bill is designed to protect charities from people who present a risk of abuse, and give the Charity Commission for England and Wales new and tougher powers to tackle serious abuse of charities. It also seeks to give charities a new legal power to invest their funds in a way that provides a financial return, and furthers the charity's aims.

GIG REVIEW: Olly Murs Welcome to UK Music Reviews » GIG REVIEW: Olly Murs Categories: Gig Reviews Olly Murs performing at Sherwood Pines Mansfield on Friday 23rd June 2017. Images and Review by Kevin Cooper In a week that saw the searing heat break all weather records, it was a cold, damp and windy night that welcomed Essex boy Olly Murs to Sherwood Pines last night. In the beautiful Forestry Commission setting it was 2015 X Factor winner, Louisa Johnson who opened the first of three concerts taking place over this weekend. Welcoming a crowd of adults and children, her soaring voice immediately engaged as she owned the stage with her single releases, Best Behaviour and So Good. Proving that she is a class act with Forever Young she then handed over the stage to the star of the night. Love or loathe Olly Murs, what he does have in bundles is a natural charm and an endearing cockiness. With no fancy visuals or pyrotechnics as evidenced when he came to the Motorpoint Arena in March this year, the crowd right at the back were able to see every bum wiggle and pout with the aid of the backdrop screen as he opened with the lively You Don't Know Love. Delivering a set list of fun filled showmanship with strokes of laddish behaviour, dad dancing and chart toppers such as Wrapped Up and Grow Up, he entertained from the off. Running around the stage he is the consummate performer making sure that everyone in his audience is having as much fun as he clearly is. With a voice that reached all parts of the forest he treated his fans to the lovely ballad, Up, which came after talk of heartbreak which was followed by some outrageous flirting with the ladies. Informing them that he was single and that he had renamed the tour 'The Find A Girlfriend Tour 2017', there was no shortage of volunteers to fill the vacancy. With Back Around morphing into Tina Turner's What's Love Got To do With It, there was plenty of opportunity to have a dance, and when Louisa Johnson joined him on the stage for his latest single, Unpredictable, there was a mass sing along from the adoring crowd. There was an old school music segment with KC & The Sunshine Band's That's The Way (I Like It), Luther Vandross' Never Too Much and MC Hammer's U Can't Touch This along with She's Got That Vibe, Can't Stop The Feeling as well as Jump Around which for a very entertaining ten minutes, the crowd did just that. With a very talented band and brilliant backing singers he wrapped things up with Dance With Me Tonight and an arm waving rendition of Years And Years. Murs had delivered 90 minutes of high energy, pure pop fun that was never less than entertaining and eight years after his X Factor days, it's still a 'Yes' from Sherwood Pines.

Urs of Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti at Ajmer Part 2 Fairs Recommended Temples Uncategorized A symbol of divine love and compassion, the marvellous marble mausoleum of Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti attracts devotees of different faiths and beliefs in great numbers not only during the annual Urs which marks his death anniversary but all through the year. Pilgrims from all walks of life and from all parts of the world consider it to be their great privilege to offer their homage and pray at the shrine. Born around 1143, at a small village Sanjar in the area of Sistan in Iran, Moinuddin lived a life of deep devotion and great austerity. Even at an early age of nine years he had commited to memory the holy Quran. He got a flour mill and a garden at the age of 15, when his father Ghjayas-ud-din died. His mother's name was Mah-e-noor. His coming in contact with Hazrat Ibrahim Kandozi made him renounce all wordly desires and he sold all that he possessed. During his stay at Samarkand, he studied holy scriptures till he was 20. Khwaja travelled to several places and met Hazrat Khwaja Usman Harun. While in Meeca, he got a divine order to go to India and spread the message of Sufism there. This brought him to India where he stayed till he left for his heavenly abode. In between, Khwaja visited plaes like Gazni, Bagdad, Lahore and Delhi. Khwaja's great emphasis on the humanitarian aspect of Islam had a great appeal for persons of all castes, creeds and conviction. The aim of his life was to get divine knowledge through prayer and meditation and then educate the masses about true religion, the core of which was to love man and tend to his needs. For him it was not enough for a Sufi saint just to pray, so he strived hard for ameliorating the lot of suffering human beings, especially the poor. This earned him the name of Gareeb Nawaz, the protector of the poor. He believed in the wise dictum of a Sufi poet who had said that to please the heart of an unhappy person was an act like going on Haj. Following the tenets of Sufism which are very close to some Indian religions, earned him great reverence of different sections of the society. A great believer in simple living, Khwaja had brought with him to India just two set of clothes, a stick, a bow and arrow, a salt case and a 'datoon'. And these were his only possessions through out his life. He never bought a third set of clothes. He himself would wash his clothes and put patches on patches when they were torn. It is said that this made his clothes weigh as much as twelve kilos at the end. He would not waste 'chapatis' and soak dried ones in water and eat them. He would spend a lot of time reading the Quran and was so lost in prayer that he would not do anything else for several days. The Urs is held from the 1st to 6th day of the Islamic month of Rajjab. The exact date of his death is not known as he had shut himself up in his cell for prayer and meditation and was found dead by his disciples when they opened it after six days. So the celebrations take place for six days. The Urs ceremonies commence with the hoisting of a flag at the Buland Darwaza. The privilege of bringing the flag now belongs to the Gauri family of Bhilwara in Rajasthan, whereas during pre-partition days it was brought from Lal Shah Baba across the border. With this ceremony, the time of the afternoon service at the main shrine changes to 7.30 p.m. The sandal paste that had deposited on the shrine during the year is peeled off and it is then distributed among the pilgrims. The Jannati Darwaza in the east of the shrine remains open all through the six days of the Urs. In the evening, it is fascinating to watch the presentation of the 'chhadi' by the Kalandars. A great attraction of the Urs fair is the visit of a class-by-itself set of pilgrims called Kalandars who come here not for the fulfilment of any desire of their own or their family, but to keep up the old tradition of their ancestors. Their prayer to the Khwaja is for the health, peace and prosperity of every citizen of the country. They are always in search for opportunities to serve humanity and also enthuse others to do so. By no means, they are beggars. The Kalandars love to spend their lives in serving at big and small 'dargahs' all over the country. They give up all wordly relations and only then are initiated into their sect. Their participation in various ceremonies during Urs adds colour to the festival. At several places in the Dargah premises can be enjoyed the singing of lilting 'qawwalis'. The Shahi Mehfil of 'qawwals' takes place in the 'mehfilkhana'. On the sixth day, before the Qul ceremony, the pilgrims wash the outer walls of the shrine with rose and lavender water, collect the holy liquid in bottles and carry it home as 'tarbarruk'. One special feature of the last day is the closing of Jannati Darwaza and another one is the holding of a mass prayer. A highly interesting sight in the shrine is the looting of rice cooked in two large 'degs' (cauldrons) with a capacity of 40 quintals and 30 quintals each Rich devotees pay for this. Cooking goes on all through the night. At dawn with the firing of a cannon, 'pirzadas' with their bodies wrapped in rags plung into the steaming food and scoop out the contents in buckets, as they have hereditary right to do so. The looted rice is then sold as 'tabarruk'. After the morning prayer, people start gathering at the holy tomb. Celebrating the Qul Day devotees recite Quran, Darood, Shigra-e-Chistia and other verses. They also tie small turbans on each other's head and pray for peace and prosperity. Thus falls the final curtain on an event at the great Sufi saint's resting place which had been bustling with people from all over the sub-continent for a week and the site of fascinating ceremonies. Ajmer Urs of Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti
"Bringing Back Bill" - in the news! William "Bill" Anthony Hoppin Howland died of natural causes on Monday, Oct. 3, 2005, in Moorestown, N.J., at the age of 92. Born in Asheville, N.C., on Aug. 5, 1913, he was the proud son of Reginald Howland and Frances Theobald Howland. Bill was a graduate of Kent School in Connecticut and the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD., class of 1937. He served as a lieutenant junior grade in the U.S. Navy until 1941. He retired to Asheville from American Airlines in 1973 after 32 years of service as a pilot based in New York. He received his masters in education and taught mathematics for New York and North Carolina schools. After retirement he volunteered and tutored inmates earning their G.E.D. He was an avid golfer and longtime member of Biltmore Forest Country Club. There was a great secret – some mystery that he feared would die with him if he didn't figure it out soon. My dad had just turned 90, and for the past year he'd been alluding to this mystery concerning two brothers – calling me almost daily and asking me to travel from New Jersey to his home in Asheville, NC to look for clues…in a graveyard. Then the quest began in earnest. Dad and I went to Asheville and found Rex's grave. We learned a lot about him from Asheville School and from old newspapers in the local library. Rex had left old family pictures and books to dad and we poured over these looking for verification. Once we felt confident that Rex was truly dad's father, we went back and changed the family genealogy records to reflect William A. H. Howland, my dad's, true parentage/lineage. It was now early 2004 and our discovery was proving overwhelming for both of us. I contacted my friend, Dr. David Grand, who specializes in EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), to see if he could help us. David was utilizing EMDR with people nearing the end of their lives and seeing amazingly positive results. David and dad met on Long Beach Island where dad's EMDR session lasted over two hours. This was remarkable due to dad's age and frailty. And it completely changed the rest of his life. "It was as if I put on a pair of glasses and saw my whole life through them differently." He told me that all of his life he thought there was something inherently unlovable about him and that explained why his "father" Stanley treated him so poorly. He thought the reason he inherited money from his "uncle" Rex was because he was the only male child who could carry on the family name. This false perception induced him to marry young and repeatedly (3 times), in order to fulfill this responsibility and also in an attempt to find a sense of family life. It's also why he had six kids! I think mom might have had something to do with that as well. In July of 2004, dad participated in a Sky Help retreat in Westchester, NY. He attended with firemen, FBI employees, a stone mason, volunteers from 9/11 and several others. While the other attendees shared the experience of the September 11th attacks, dad's "life changing event" was realizing who his true father was late in his life. He was a beloved inspiration to the other's attending the retreat. Dad was one of Sky Help's original board members and back in 2000, had helped me to fill out and file the tons of paperwork needed to apply for status as a non-profit organization. We never anticipated then how integral Sky Help would be in helping our own family through trauma and powerful transformation. Though I was not a participant in this particular workshop, my heart overflowed with love and pride when I realized what a positive and inspiring impact dad had on the group and how emotionally attached to him they were. The greatest part was to see dad enjoying this and to see him joking around with the Irish stone mason and a NYC fireman. He turned out to be the "star" of the workshop. The next great adventure was in February of 2005 when dad, the NYC fireman, the Irish stone mason and I went to St. John, USVI on vacation together. We stayed in what we dubbed, the "handicapped tent" since dad was using a cane. The shower was a hung up water hose and the only thing remotely handicapped was a ramp that led to the cabin door! This didn't stop dad at all… he was a total trooper! We watched the Super Bowl at a bar, spent lots of time with binoculars on the beach and laughed so hard we cried for days. Dad and Sean wanted to eat smelly dead fish (kippers) for breakfast, just to gross everyone out. Sean and Jim also kept threatening to throw the "old bloke" over the railing if he didn't stop making fun of them. It was my favorite vacation ever and dad was definitely at his wittiest and most charming. Experiencing dad's transformation was a life changing and healing experience for me. He was transformed as a father and the kind smile that his journey had finally given him was there every day for the rest of his life. He enjoyed sitting around and thinking about his real father and remembering things from his life. There was no longer a single soul alive that could be embarrassed or shamed by the news. Dad wanted to shout his truth from the mountain tops. Which brings me to the film about his life, "Bringing Back Bill." Dad said that no one could make up a better story and the fact that it was true gave it a more powerful reason to be told! I am in the process of compiling the facts of Dad's discovered mystery – which includes a WWII torpedo bomber named the Devastator crashed off the coast of San Diego, a mysterious tattoo, the talented and sometimes disturbing art of a searching mind, the acceptance of an autistic son, a family legacy in dispute and a series of plot twists that continue to keep everyone guessing. We have about 6 to 8 hours of film footage and I'm talking with a couple of independent film producers. I could never have done any of this if dad had not believed in me, encouraged me, helped with the details and participated directly. My life's work – Sky Help, Inc. – is the direct result of William A. H. Howland's epiphany and his willingness to share his journey with all those who would grow and heal from the experience.
As an alumnus of the celebrated Screwed Up Click, rapper Lil' Keke knows that his fans have been anticipating his much-delayed Swishahouse debut, Loved By Few, Hated By Many, for roughly two years. Planning for the album to finally be heard later this year, Don Ke has scooped up fellow Houstonians, Slim Thug and Paul Wall, for a tribute to everyone making Money In Tha City (whether legally or illegally). With Baton Rouge native Tre Virdure's hook vocals and Mr. Lee's street-certified production, Money In Tha City has the makings of yet another underground street anthem in the veins of Chunk Up The Deuce and Ima G. Loved By Few, Hated By Many is currently scheduled for release this September.

These Glory Days is created by Mr. Magnus Beckman. His interest for fashion began in his childhood as his grandfather, Lennart, was an employee at the famous NK department store in Stockholm, and introduced him to the classical look of a true gentleman. The inspiration for this brand are gentlemen who appreciate design, fit & details, like his grandfather did. These Glory Days believe that price should reflect quality, and our ambition is that everybody should be able to afford well-designed clothes. Most of the clothes are based on old classic garments that every gentleman should have in his wardrobe.
Time to Regroup on Iran Israelis - and Jewish people the world over- now know that neither the Democratic administration nor American Jewry will be there for them on critical matters of security. David Friedman Aug 31, 2015, 11:50 AM (GMT+3) Iran Nuclear ProgramProportionality The JCPOA is not going to be thwarted by Congress. Even if the Senate musters the 60 votes necessary to break a filibuster and reject the deal, there is no chance that it will produce enough votes to override a presidential veto. So for the near term, the United States will be a party to this reckless act of appeasement. Our political leaders, especially the Jewish ones, have failed us. Jerry Nadler, an outspoken supporter of Israel and a long time congressman from one of New York's most Jewish districts, proved to be all talk and no action. Obama had him at hello. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a congresswoman from a heavily Jewish district in South Florida and head of the Democratic National Committee, elevated politics over principle. Over and over again, she went on the airwaves to defend the Iran deal, spouting the nonsensical talking points fed her by the administration. Other Jewish legislators were no better. Even Chuck Schumer, who will vote against the deal, did nothing to exercise the considerable influence he has over his colleagues. Our non-political leadership failed us as well. While there were notable exceptions, many prominent American Jews – in the rabbinate, academia, the arts and elsewhere – were all too quick to support the Iran deal. In the face of united opposition to the deal from the State of Israel – spanning the far left to the far right – many American Jews, none with any expertise in military security, nonetheless honored their loyalty to Obama above all else. Incredibly, a greater percentage of American Jews support the Iran deal than the population at large. We must now confront the painful reality that Israel currently cannot trust a Democratic administration nor a majority of the American Jewish community to side with it on critical and existential matters of security. That is not to say that the relationship between the two countries is, God forbid, irreconcilably broken. A Republican administration will hopefully emerge that will share Israel's world view, and, even under a Democratic administration, military cooperation and coordination between the USA and Israel is at a very high level (in the interests of both sides) and does not appear to be in jeopardy (at least not yet). But it is unfortunately apparent that many of Israel's friends in America have disappointed us and proven unreliable in observing their pledges of loyalty and support when needed the most. Incredibly, a greater percentage of American Jews support the Iran deal than the population at large. Among the perilous consequences of the current situation is the potential loss of Israel's power of deterrence against its enemies. Terrorist organizations read the same newspapers that we do, and they are gleeful in their perception that the United States, including its Jewish leaders, has abandoned Israel in its time of need. As they see Israel in an increasingly weakened state, their aggression is likely to increase proportionately. Israel must respond to its rejection by the United States and send a clear message to its enemies who undoubtedly are salivating over their good fortune. If I were Bibi Netanyahu, I might write a letter that looks something like this: Mr. President: You have acted in a manner that you deem in the best interests of your country. Now Israel must do the same. For decades, Israel has shown great restraint against its hostile neighbors to accommodate the geopolitical goals of the United States. In the First Gulf War, Israel was besieged by scud missiles from Iraq but held its fire to permit the United States to maintain a coalition with Arab countries. Following each of its defensive wars, Israel has returned land validly captured at the request of the American administration. More recently, Israel has responded to indiscriminate rocket fire into its population centers with the type of limited force that no other country would consider, all at the request of our American ally. "Ten years ago, Israel evacuated 8000 Jews from Gaza with the support of the United States in an attempt to demonstrate its commitment to Palestinian self-determination. The evacuation almost split the country in half and ultimately proved disastrous, but it was at least accompanied by a letter from then-president George W. Bush that recognized the permanence of a Jewish presence in Judea and Samaria. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ripped up that letter virtually the day you appointed her. Israel thus has proven, time and time again, that it is willing to make great sacrifices on account of its friendship with, and loyalty to, the United States, with only mixed results in return. But never have Israel's concerns been so completely rejected as in the case of the Iran agreement. Your intent to implement a deal with Iran at all costs puts my country at an untenable risk, both in the short and the long term. In the short term, you will be funding Hezbollah and Hamas with billions of dollars to terrorize our population. In the long term – only 10 years from now – you will have created a nuclear Iran. As our enemies rejoice in their good fortune and predictions of Israel's demise – all a direct result of the JCPOA -- Israel must re-calibrate its security platform in response. With our enemies expected to grow stronger with enhanced weapons, and more emboldened by the return of Iran to the community of nations, we can no longer follow a path of 'proportionate force' in response to attacks against our people -- attacks that American leaders have acknowledged will result from the implementation of the JCPOA. Such proportionality, followed to its logical conclusion, will only encourage further militancy and ultimately lead to our destruction. Rather, we are respectfully informing the leadership of the United States, our greatest friend, as well as all of our enemies, that any further attacks on Israel, whether by rocket, by tunnel, by incursion or otherwise, will be met with entirely disproportionate force – the type of force every other nation has used and will use under comparable circumstances -- designed to immediately end the battle and discourage and deter further misconduct. You have left us with no other choice. Winston Churchill is considered by many to be the greatest leader of his generation. To defeat the Nazis, Churchill, in coordination with American forces, bombed population centers in Dresden, Germany and elsewhere in early 1945. Civilian life was lost but the war quickly ended, Nazism was defeated and Churchill was regaled as a hero. No one holds life to be more precious than the People of Israel and we will never target civilians. But we will no longer permit human shields to limit our self-defense and we will send a clear message to deter the terrorist attacks that we know are coming. We will not be held to a different standard than the United States, we will not bow to the world's hypocrisy and we will defeat Islamic terrorism by any and all means necessary. I hope this clarifies our position in response to the JCPOA's approval. Binyamin Netanyahu

Q: Getting GraphicDeviceManager from another class I've been searching for a way to use the GraphicDeviceManager in other classes that don't inherit from Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game I'm using the Game State Management example. I've got a class called "FirstLevel" which is essentialy GamePlayScreen from the example, I'm trying to get that class to use the GraphicsDeviceManager to do code such as the following; this.graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = 1920; this.graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = 1080; But it has no idea what "graphics" actually is. What are my options in terms of getting a hold of a GraphicsDeviceManager and using it in the FirstLevel class? I can't inherit from Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game because my class is already inheriting from GameScreen. I heard somwhere that you can use the DrawableGameComponent class to access a GraphicsDeviceManager, such as the class "ScreenManager" which inherits from this class. I cant pass Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game into the constructor of firstLevel because other classes that call it need to get the GraphicsDeviceManager to pass into it. Any help guys? Thanks. A: The usual is passing to your GameScreen constructor the game instance as a Game parameter. A GraphicDeviceManager is used to initializate graphics, inside a game you should use the GraphicsDevice instance provided by the game instance. public class GameScreen { public Game Game; public GameScreen(Game game) { this.Game = game; } public void Update() { Game.GraphicsDevice.... } }

American heritage brands' lack of extravagant ad campaigns or the perception of a complicated marketing strategy is a major part of their appeal. The idealized heritage brand marches on unaware and unconcerned with fashion trends, instead focusing on core customers and quality products. Filson is now trying to expand their business while staying loyal to their brand image. The Portland store exemplifies these efforts. I met Nathan Gray, Filson Store Manager, a couple days ago on my visit to the store and chatted a little about the possibility of Goldwin Inc, Filson's Japanese Distributor, opening a store in Tokyo. Yesterday I exchanged a few emails with Nathan and continued our conversation about the heritage movement and Filson's retail strategy. Here are a few questions with Nathan. Foster: How much business do you get from people buying Filson due to the recent interest in American heritage brands? Nathan: So far, the vast majority of our sales have been from our loyal Oregon customers who are delighted that we've opened a store closer than Seattle. I hope that our great location in the Pearl will turn a lot of new customers on to our brand. I believe that Portland will be an ideal location for us due to the interest in American heritage brands and the strong attraction this community has for natural products. Foster: So Filson is using the Portland store as concept store to test the waters of expanding Filson to a new market? Interesting. Nathan: I don't know that I would describe us as a "concept test store." One of the goals of any retailer is to increase their customer base, and hopefully the amount of exposure we will get here in the Pearl District will help in that aim. Filson's apparent marketing strategy differs from that of other American heritage brands like Woolrich and Red Wing, who have launched sub-brands to capture on the resurgence movement. These sub-brands, Woolrich Woolen Mills and Red Wing Heritage, have their own websites, sales distribution, and collections. Filson has instead tried to overhaul their own brand by putting up vintage ads on their website (as attached in the article), and launching stores in strategic locations, Portland and potentially Tokyo, to capitalize on the resurgence movement. My conversation with Nathan accentuated the differences between Filson and Woolrich and Red Wing's approach to capitalizing on the resurgence movement. It will be interesting to see how these two different approaches will weather the economic crisis and the current heritage fashion trend.

Home/Sports/Clifford takes Kingdom out of the corner with belated idleness when Mayo boss Horan refuses to speak in solidarity act Clifford takes Kingdom out of the corner with belated idleness when Mayo boss Horan refuses to speak in solidarity act Kerry remains in a high position to secure a third Allianz League title after ending both Mayo's unbeaten run this season and their 12-season unbeaten run on Kerry soil last night. Notably, this was Kerry's first win over Mayo at home since 2009 when Jack O'Connor was in the first season of his second term as Kingdom boss. A point from David Clifford in sixth minute of stoppage time substitute Stephen O'Brien earned two points for Jack O'Connor's side. So far in this reign, his team has barely misplaced a single foot. They are currently on an eight-match unbeaten streak and have secured a spot in the tournament final with the most unlikely combination of the remaining penalty shootouts. Mayo still has a chance to be the tournament decider by the first weekend of April although at this stage their focus is probably shifting to the Connacht title match against Galway on April 24. . Mayo dominated territory early but converted only one of their three early scoring opportunities through Matthew Ruane as they struggled with Kerry's protective defence. Kerry responded with a brace – a spectacular first attempt by Clifford after he missed marker Oisín Mullin. Mayo nearly scored in the 11th minute when Fergal Boland was overturned and Dara Moynihan linked up with David Clifford, but Tony Brosnan chose to punch the ball over the bar rather than test goalkeeper Rob Hennelly. When given the opportunity, Mayo cornered Kerry and gave Shane Murphy a headache. Ruane flipped one of his re-emergences and linked up with Fergal Boland, who turned it into a one-point (4-3) game after 16 minutes. David Clifford was engaged for the only goal of the game as he started to move to link Adrian Spillane on the right and his pass was successfully completed by Tony Brosnan. Mayo should have responded immediately after Aidan O'Shea put Aiden Orme past, but he shot far away – and Mayo's poor finish cost them in the half as they went up 5 points from 3 the home team's goal, although Kerry missed three. short photo. Scores appreciated for the rest of the half and even though Clifford fouled Stephen Coen to kick Kerry's sixth point. All but two of those scores came directly from Mayo's first leg. Mayo's growing dominance in the middle third becomes more apparent despite Ruane, Jordan Flynn and Aidan O'Shea making major changes. The away team should have scored in stoppage time. Once again, Ruane joined the rally, but 'keeper Murphy made a brilliant save from Diarmuid O'Connor's shot that went wide of the post '45, Rob Hennelly diverted it to give Kerry a 1-6 to 0 lead- 6 at break. Brosnan and O'Donoghue (free) swapped points early in the second half. Then Kevin McLoughlin, who had only seconds on the field, overturned Kerry's possession. He teamed up with Aidan O'Shea, who linked up with Fergal Boland for a third. David Clifford was awarded a visionary corner, but O'Donoghue from the corner helped the game two points after scoring a superb mark. Paudie Clifford missed a 13-yard penalty where Kerry should have had a four-point advantage in the 56th minute and when O'Donoghue scored a harder goal on the other end shortly after, the game resumed. with 2 points again. Dara Moynihan was penalized for being too close to Rob Hennelly's long-range shot and O'Donoghue took the free kick before Ruane leveled with seven minutes remaining. Clifford free posting has restored Kerry's advantage; Paddy Durcan had two dangerous shots from long range in the sixth minute of stoppage time. Mullin won a questionable penalty that O'Donoghue nailed to level the score in the 73rd minute. But Kerry got out and Aidan O'Shea fouled his replacement Stephen O'Brien whom Clifford converted and it proved the winning score. For the first time Kerry prevailed in a tight finish. They will have concerns about the effectiveness of their midfield pairing. But on a night when the weather turns into a sport spoilt, they will be happy to finally win at home against Mayo. Mayo coach James Horan did not speak to the media before and after the game. According to a spokesman for the County Board of Directors, he was acting in solidarity with the GPA, who are in dispute with the Croke Park administration over the players' expenses.

El Greco's single-minded style rejected naturalism and rejected accessibility. Works such as The Disrobing of Christ (1577–79), The Burial of the Count of Orgaz (1586–88), and The Vision of St John (1608–14) reveal elongated, twisted figures; unreal colors; and an experimental rendering of space — all resistant to easy viewing and intent, instead, on an art of epic grandeur and intellectual beauty. Michael Scholz-Hänsel studied art history, history, theater studies, and Hispanic studies in Berlin and Hamburg, earning his doctorate in 1984. He has taught at Leipzig University since 2002 and has published widely, especially on topics relating to the Hispanic world. His research focuses on cross-cultural influences in the Mediterranean area, for example in the work of El Greco and Jusepe de Ribera.

WHAT COLOR WAS JESUS THE CHRIST The most common answer, "He was not blond and blue-eyed like they show him in movies and paintings. He was darker than that, like the people who live in North Africa today." However, the average American today looks nothing like the average American 500 years ago when Columbus arrived. So why expect the North Africans of today to necessarily resemble those of more than 2,000 years ago? Some point to phrases in the Bible that say, "His eyes are like blazing fire, his feet like burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of many waters." which would indicate a very black man with a deep voice. And there are depictions of Christ like this in some Black churches, and some ancient statues and paintings show him this way. However, doesn't the second commandment explicitly forbid the making of "graven images?" So how come there are so many depictions of Christ, as Black or white? Muslims have no depiction of Jesus Christ or any of the prophets, neither do Jews, or many Christian sects. However, Catholics and many Protestant sects do have icons, usually of a white Jesus. And note that it is Catholics and the Protestant sects with the white Jesus icon that sent out missionaries in the wake of the European conquerors and colonizers. Note that the literal meaning of "Catholic" is "universal." The Catholic Church purports to be universal, a faith for everyone. However, how can any faith that holds that certain of its members look like God, and others do not, be all-encompassing? Once the prophets, or God himself, as many Christians hold Jesus Christ to be, is pictured as any color, then all who are not of that color would have to have a lesser status. However, there is an even deeper question. Did Jesus Christ really exist? Because this is a predominantly Christian country, the mass media acts as if Jesus Christ is an undisputed, real historical figure. As a result many, if not most, are not aware that there is a historical debate as to whether or not such a person really existed. Who or what one believes, or does not believe, is a purely personal matter. But it is a fact that there is great controversy over Christ's authenticity. Here is a little test. Tell me, who am I referring to? He died in his 33rd year. He said the man married to his mother was not his father. He said he was fathered by a God. He was called, "King of Kings." And the name "Issus" was connected to him. Who was that? Jesus? Yes, but all these things are also true of Alexander the Great. It has been claimed that Christ is a re-configuring of the supreme Western conquerer, Alexander, as a supremely religious figure. The Persians invaded and conquered Egypt in 666 BCE. The Greeks under Alexander came in 333 BCE. Alexander's general Ptolemy, after Alexander's death, inherited the throne of Egypt and was declared Pharaoh. The Ptolemaic line was the last Pharaonic dynasty; its last member was Cleopatra. After Cleopatra, the Romans seized Egypt. The Romans, at first, persecuted the Christians until, that is, the Emperor Constantine converted to the Christian faith. However, Walter Williams in The Historical Origins of Christianity disputes that last claim. He offers evidence that Constantine did not convert to Christianity, but, instead, created it! Williams says that the Romans were not putting Christians to death, that they were persecuting the last stubborn remnants of the original, ancient Egyptian religion. Constantine, says Williams, ceased his attacks on them once they agreed to convert Egyptian religion into what is now known as Christianity. That is why the earliest statues of Christ and his mother are Black. They are based on the Egyptian holy figures Isis and her son, Osiris. Notre Dame and many European cathedrals are, in fact, built on sites that were originally temples to Isis. Notice, how in Southern Europe the "Mother of God," is often given as much, if not more, attention and veneration than Christ. Williams, and others, say this is because Mary is really a refiguring of the goddess Isis, and Jesus is a recasting of her son, Osiris. The Romans badly needed a central religious figure to hold together their ever expanding Empire. Observe that the Pope is called the "Pontiff." One of the titles of the Roman Emperor was "Pontifex Maximus." Also, look at the hat, called the "mitre," that the Pope and all the bishops of the Catholic Church wear. It is based on the double crown of the Egyptian pharaoh. The pharaoh was the intermediary between the people and the gods, the Roman Emperor and later the pope assumed that pivotal role. After the fall of Rome, the various kings that rose up across Europe claimed to rule by, "Divine Right." So we see that starting with the simple question, "What color was Christ?" we can explore a host of historical issues and perspectives. But, bottom line, what is the truth? Only you can decide. However, unless you read and think for yourself, others will make up your mind for you and thereby decide your fate.

Do you know of any legally published process for making certain you have the most important feature novelty, recency in the thesis for your essay? Thought so. Me neither of them. Textbooks and teachers just show you pieces of writing that contain newness in them, and they say, Do it like that. Means, sure, they give you isolated types of the forms you should use, including Introductions, Thesis Statements, Matter Sentences, Body Paragraphs, and Conclusions. But they never give you a specific, reusable p-r-o-c-e-s-s for creating any of them, do they? They have kind of like a shoemaker exhibiting an apprentice a pack full of shoes and stating, Here's what they look like. Right now make some like these. Right? Yeah, right!

Does the dark web aid and abet terrorist groups? Juliana Kenny Mar 31, 2016, 2:58 PM EDT (Source: Image Catalog/flickr) As the threat of ISIS spreads around the world, taking hold of countries including France, Belgium, and the U.S., governments are grasping to understand how the terrorist organization proliferates. One fact has become clear: ISIS has money, and governments are now looking at systems such as the "dark web", bitcoin, and other underground networks to see if they are partially to blame for helping terrorist groups find and secure funding. The 2016 CIGI-Ipsos Global Survey on Internet Security and Trust, undertaken by the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) and conducted by global research company Ipsos interviewed 24,143 web users in 24 countries between November 20, 2015 and December 4, 2015. 71% of those respondents said that the "dark net" should be shut down. Three in 10 respondents said the dark net should remain in existence. This disparity highlights a few points, one of which is that most users probably don't know exactly what the dark net is and associate it with the underbelly of the internet and criminal activity. Indeed, the dark net — networks primarily used for illegal file-sharing and what have become associated with systems such as the Silk Road and Pirate Bay — is the home for plenty of illegal activity. But in the wake of devastating terrorist attacks, the world is scrambling to understand how groups such as ISIS stay funded, and it sees the dark net as a threat in this regard, mainly because most people don't understand what it is or how it works. That isn't the only unknown. Some governments are attempting to figure out if and how they should regulate systems like bitcoin to get a better hold on the underbelly of the internet. In January, Germany and France both called for stricter bitcoin regulation and regulation of payments systems on the web to insure against financing terrorism. It's difficult to find evidence of bitcoin used for funding terrorist group activity, but because the jury is still out on whether or not the dark net allows such financing to fly under the radar, it's a popular culprit. Still, around one-third of respondents to the aforementioned survey believe the dark net should stay — something no amount of government policy or public opinion will actually determine. And Fen Hampson, director of CIGI's Global Security & Politics Program and co-director of the Global Commission on Internet Governance says that the anonymity aspect of the dark web is what complicates the issue for many people. He said: "The opinions expressed by global citizens on the Dark Net, a faceless realm functioning purely on anonymity, demonstrate the complexity of this issue for policymakers and governments around the world. Simply put, anonymity and the privacy of users must be central determinants in guiding the future of creating systems and boundaries to govern the Internet." As the global threat of ISIS continues to impact policy-making, the shadowy sections of the internet will undoubtedly remain in the mix.

The cause of death was listed as Rocket/Mortar. At the time of his death James was 24 years of age. He was from Independence, Missouri. James is honored on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial at Panel 34E, Line 4. The decorations earned by 1LT James Oris Blankenship include: the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Parachute Badge, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Vietnam Campaign Medal and the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm Unit Citation. My husband, James Oris Blankenship, was killed in VN on Jan 8, 1968. We met just before he graduated from OCS at Ft Benning (Class #10-66). We dated while he was assigned to jump school at Ft Benning. It was truly Gods design to have us fall in love and have what little time we had together. We were married at Ft Sill, Oklahoma where we were blessed with a son before he left for VN (Douglas James, now 42). Our sons twin daughter (Julia Mae), died 7 days after birth. In those 2 months of fatherhood before going to VN, I saw a man torn between the desire to be with his family and raise his son and his loyalty to his country. We mourn his loss each day. And feel sad for those who never had the chance to spend time with this wonderful and beautiful person. Jill Blankenship Riedel -- Peoria AZ USA -- 05/30/2010 Lt. Blankenship is buried at Fort Sill, OK From the book Through the Valley, Vietnam, 1967-1968 by James F Humphries, at p. 134: "More troops were on the way to reinforce 4-31. During the early evening hours of 8 January the Americal Division had directed the 2-35th Infantry, 3d Brigade, 4th Infantry Division into the Hiep Duc Valley. The 2-35th Infantry would share FSB West with 4-31 and operate between Hill 445 and the Chang River. The battalions Company D would go first, with the remainder of 2-35 closing sometime on the 10th. And from page 138: "By 0430 (9 January) the movement had ceased, and the NVA pulled back down the hill. Mellon reported the company at 50 percent alert. Company D, 2-35th Infantry, in positions on the south side of the perimeter, had two (Jackson and Quitmeyer) killed and three wounded during the NVA attack." "At the end of February, the 3d Brigade, 4th Infantry Division ceded its operational area to the 196th LIB and, minus the 2-35th Infantry that followed later, moved south to rejoin the 4th Infantry Division. ... When the dust settled 4-31 was on LZ Colt; 1-6 had secured LZ Baldy; 2-35 had FSB Ryder; 2-1 was at LZ Ross; 3-21 remained on FSB Center; and 1-1st Cavalry Squadron continued to operate in the eastern sector of the Que Son Valley and the costal lowlands." (His BSM Citation) The Bronze Star Medal is presented to First Lieutenant James O Blankenship for meritorious service in connection with military operations against an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam. First Lieutenant Blankenship distinguished himself while serving as a Platoon Leader with Company D, 2/35th Infantry during the period September 1967 to January 1968. Upon taking command of his platoon, First Lieutenant Blankenship demonstrated fine leadership ability and honed his men in infantry tactics as a small unit as well as an integral part of the company. Under the strain and hardships of combat, he remained calm and accomplished all missions in a highly professional manner. Through his cheerful attitude and deep concern for his men, he earned the respect and admiration of his men, fellow officers, and superiors. On 9 January 1968, First Lieutenant Blankenship was participating in a combat assault in Quang Tin Province when fragments from a nearby exploding mortar round mortally wounded him. His aggressiveness, professional integrity, and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.
Heretic Outreach picks Sundance Competition title "Human Factors" Heretic Outreach is proud to add to its slate the sophomore suspense drama HUMAN FACTORS (previously known as ZORRO) by Ronny Trocker, produced by Zischlermann filmproduktion, Bagarrefilm, Snowglobe and ZDF and set to world premiere in competition at Sundance. Told through narrative loops and shifting lenses, the film places in the center of the narrative a family only to unveil the fragility of truth in the hyper-mediatized world and the power of individual perspective. The film follows Jan, Nina and their two kids, a cosmopolitan, middle-class family. Nina and Jan have a successful career as account executives at their advertising company, but when Jan accepts to work on the campaign of a political party, Nina's exclusion from the decision-making leads to doubting and mistrust. When they decide to spend a family weekend at their house in a coastal holiday resort, a mysterious home invasion sets everything off balance. While they try to put the incident into perspective, agitation triggers off a shake in the family core. Ioanna Stais, Head of Sales & Acquisitions at Heretic Outreach, comments: "HUMAN FACTORS is a visually stunning and intense experience. When diving into the world of the film, you can't help falling for its narrative techniques and the intriguing characters. What we find remarkable about the film is that, weeks after first watching it, we are still peeling off different layers of the narrative and discovering new ways of approaching it".

This is a simple process for clarifying your thinking for getting things done. It is based on the interrogative questions of Why, What, Who, How, When and Where. The diagram speaks for itself, I hope you find it useful. It seems to be designed for capturing ideas and turning them into reality. You can use this for creating a product, a project or anything where an idea needs some clarification of thoughts. You will notice that there is no copyright on it.

In May 2017 we were invited to meet with BMT Hi-Q Sigma to discuss developing their branding. design146 had previously worked with the client at Altus and were keen to be involved. BMT Hi-Q Sigma is a Management Consultancy, based in Bath, providing services across Government, Defence, Energy and Transport sectors to improve their portfolio, programme and project performance. They already have a set of existing brand guidelines, but needed some help to develop them further to show how they might be adapted to more flexible layouts that are efficient on space. To kick things off, we have worked on a branding development presentation and some Case Studies and White Papers. We're looking forward to seeing how the branding develops as we work on other marketing collateral to include infographics, branded merchandise, and internal comms pieces.

Love, Deep Throat": 'Dick' at 20, and the Bygone Age of Strong Political Satire This month marks the 20th anniversary of Dick, a beautifully sharp satire of the Watergate scandal. The film arrived in August of 1999 (25 years after Nixon's resignation) and was full of in-jokes aimed at boomers who had lived through the Watergate scandal and knew its details backwards and forwards, mostly from Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's books, the All The President's Men movie, and Oliver Stone's Nixon, which had arrived just four years earlier. The genius of Dick's script, credited to director Andrew Fleming and his co-writer Sheryl Longin was that it filled what were then the mysteries of Watergate, from the identity of Deep Throat to the story behind the 18 1/2 minute gap. The film arrived in August of 1999 (25 years after Nixon's resignation) and was full of in-jokes aimed at boomers who had lived through the Watergate scandal… In the film, a pair of 15-year-old girls (played by Michelle Williams and Kirsten Dunst) live in the Watergate complex, and through a series of misunderstandings, are invited to become the official dog walkers for Checkers, the dog belonging to President Nixon (Dan Hedaya). Their interactions with Nixon, Forrest Gump-like, help lead to a wide variety of world historical events between 1972 and 1974. They feed Nixon pot brownies, leading him to enter into peace talks to end the Vietnam War. They accidentally convince John Dean to resign and cooperate against Nixon. And then they become "Deep Throat," a fact that stayed a secret for decades because Woodward and Bernstein (Will Ferrell and Bruce McCulloch) were too embarrassed to tell anyone about it. No X in Nixon The movie is funny on its own merits, while also full of hilarious in-jokes for people who know every detail of Watergate. Dan Hedaya is one of the better movie Nixons, up there with Philip Baker Hall and Anthony Hopkins, and the cast is chockful of veterans of The Kids in the Hall in mid-'90s-era Saturday Night Live. And watch for a young Ryan Reynolds, as Haldeman's teenaged son. It's hard to top the ending of All The President's Men, but Dick somehow matches it: Today's Dick As you may have noticed, there hasn't been the equivalent of a movie like Dick recently. It's not exactly a golden time for political satire, especially at the movies. A lot of people believed that the Trump era would be a strong time for comedy, but it really hasn't worked out that way, as every once-formidable major comedy organ from Saturday Night Live to The Onion to The Daily Show has utterly failed to contend with the Trump era. A lot of people believed that the Trump era would be a strong time for comedy, but it really hasn't worked out that way… The major Trump-era comedy touchstones, it appears, are Alec Baldwin's weak-tea Trump impression and late-night hosts who have turned to "clapter" – liberal platitudes that may earn audience applause, but certainly not laughs. Re-assessing 'American Beauty' On Its 20th Anniversary Adam McKay, the longtime writing partner of Will Ferrell (who played Bob Woodward in Dick), not only has pivoted from comedy to earnest political films, but made a movie last year not about the Trump Administration but rather Dick Cheney. There's some funny stuff at the margins, like James Adomian's impression of Sebastian Gorka, and while the Showtime cartoon Our Cartoon President does occasional decent material, its Trump character is a dud at all times. Even Sacha Baron Cohen's Who is America? drew most of its brilliant humor out of its Israeli colonel character; the more Trump-adjacent parts of the show were much less successful. Why has comedy struggled with Trump so much? I return to Patton Oswalt's analogy: "Imagine there's a guy out on the sidewalk, and he's just taking a dump on the pavement, and he's yelling about Hitler, and he's hanging wallpaper. So you think of the funniest joke about a guy taking a dump on the sidewalk, and you turn to tell your friend. And as you turn to tell your friend, behind you, he has scooped up his poop and made a sombrero out of it." A 21st Century Dick? Will we get better satire about Trump at some point in the future? It's certainly possible. Dick, after all, came out a quarter century after Nixon's fall. In the meantime, I would love to see an In the Loop-style treatment of the Trump Administration, or one that finds a strange, side-entrance into mockery of the current White House. But a Trump satire along the lines of Dick? It's just hard to imagine it working. America is so fragmented, with "shared memory" essentially a thing of the past, that it's hard to imagine lightning striking twice in such a way.

A scarce view of Genoa naming some 56 important locations. A scarce c. 1725-1750 panoramic view of Genoa, Italy by Martin Engelbrecht. This view follows the work of Jeremias Wolff who produced a large format view of Genoa earlier. Engelbrecht presents us with a busy harbor, with merchant ships coming and going. In the city itself he identifies some 55 specific buildings. This view was drawn by Martin Englebrecht and published in Augsburg by Friederich Bernhard Werner. Martin Engelbrecht (1684-1756) and his brother Christian were artists, print sellers, and engravers based in Augsburg, Germany, during the first half of the 18th Century. The Engelbrecht firm was established in 1717 and produced more than 5,000 printed. Among their work are city views issued by Friedrich Bernhard Werner and others. The duo are better known for creating miniature diorama cards which, inserted into a display box offered religious scenes from a three dimensional perspective. They are the only engravers to have been granted a royal permission to produce such scenes – which at the time seemed magical. They also produced portraits of monarchs and other local dignitaries. The work of the Engelbrecht brothers has been called "beyond compare." The Engelbrecht firm launched the careers of several other artists, including Jeremias Wachsmuht and Johann David Nessenthaler. Friedrich Bernhard Werner (1690-1778) was a German-born civil engineer, trained in Nice, who went on to become an accomplished copper-plate engraver, interested in subjects of cityscapes, monuments, churches, and public works. During the mid-18th century Werner travelled extensively in Central Europe documenting the architecture of its most prominent cities. Good. Blank on verso. Marginal soiling.
Q: Force page refresh and jump to a #section It seems that I must be missing something completely elementary. What I'm trying to achieve looks like quite a common case, and so it makes me wonder why there is no straightforward way. The problem is that I would like to refresh the current page from JavaScript and simultaneously land on a #section. If I do simply: document.location.href = document.location.href + "#section"; all browsers I tested just scroll to that #section (no reload). It makes sense in a way. Just for completeness, if I do document.location.assign(document.location.href + "#section"); it does the same thing (not surprisingly; it boils down internally to the same function for sure). Finally, the document object seems to have also the document.reload() function which takes an optional boolean argument specifying whether I want to force the reload, but obviously, it does not allow to specify the #section. The only way I could find (using these methods) was the following combination: document.location.assign(document.location.href + "#section"); document.location.reload(); But it is not ideal, because as you have probably guessed, it scrolls and then reloads which causes the browser to actually scroll three times in the end. I know that there are ways around it: server side redirect or adding some unique random query string parameter, but it seems strange that there is no simple way. A: That is the "hash" value of the location object. You need to set it like this... location.hash = "#section"; If that does not work consistently, you might want to consider using a scrollToElement function... function scrollToElement(elem) { if(typeof elem == 'string') elem = document.getElementById(elemId); var top = 0; if(elem) { if(elem.offsetParent) { top = elem.offsetTop; while(elem = elem.offsetParent) { top += elem.offsetTop; } } window.scrollTo(0, top); } } If you absolutely need a page reload (not sure why you ever would), try opening a window in itself... window.open(location.href + '#section', '_top'); Or try replace... location.replace(location.href + '#section'); A: There is a much much simpler solution: if (document.location.href.match(/[?]/)) document.location.href = document.location.href + '&fake_param=' + Math.random() + '#section' ; else document.location.href = document.location.href + '?fake_param=' + Math.random() + '#section' ;
Alrighty, still getting used to the culture. @Baavgai, so I tried testing that code out in a console app and I got this message from the debugger, what should I do? Show your code. How did you implement the class Val? Note, I only gave the header, the body is an exercise for you. Well I haven't really implemented it per se, basically just copied your code to see if I could get it working in a Win32 console program as I usually test concepts in command line instead of windows forms. I think I need to do some tutorials today on implementing classes. I will be back after I get a little more familiar with classes. I added your code to a .cpp item not a header though. I'm not using a header because for this test because I usually just compile a lone .cpp file when I'm doing command line apps. Let me do some research on classes and report back. Thanks again! Curious - how do you read that error? White on turquoise is not really conducive to reading.. like white on yellow. I have the hue adjusted on my video adapter. There are two screens and I offset the hue on one so that on my programming screen light blue is light purple and the brightness is turned down so it's easier to read than it appears there. That seems.. odd. Why would you want to misrepresent colors? Why not just use a different default highlight color? He's likely running f.lux. I've started using it to keep from waking my kids up while I use the dual monitor. OK so I'm learning about classes, I see where you're going with this. So basically you've created a class that will keep the values for the integers within the specified boundaries? I'm still going to have to figure out why it's giving that message but at least I now understand what this class thing is doing. Please forgive me, I've only been programming in C++ in my free time (which isn't much) and the only other programming language that I know is TI Basic (which is far simpler for trigonometric functions and input/output) so I'm still getting used to the complexities and intricacies of C++. I'm at work, we have windows 10 here, windows 10 is extremely boring looking. I use the hue to spice up the interface a bit because when I was kid we used to have gradient title bars in windows 98 and it made the OS less BORING. Did you try playing with these settings? Anyway other than the new flat "Metro" UI making a statement about departure from older versions of Windows, it actually also has the side effect of being much more energy efficient because a lot less CPU/GPU power is needed to render screen. This was a big boost in helping the battery life for Windows laptops and tablets. Of course, if you have a $1500 gaming video card on your desktop, it pretty much underutilized even if most of Windows 10 uses DirectDraw. Enough offtopic from me, though. OP: baavgai's class is such that when you instantiate an object of it, you give it a starting value, and min and max values. The object stores those values for later use. You probably should make sure that the value is in the min...max range, BUT, depending on what you want - you may even let the starting value be lesser than min, or larger than max - you'd just have to take care off appropriately setting the starting "direction" of the step. // 1, 4, 7, 10, ...? Xupicor, NICE!!!!! TY! I'm going to give this a shot. Be back in a second. Appreciate the help. Skydiver, yes I changed that but the personalization options that have been in windows since 98 are all gone as of Win10. I understand what you're saying about the resource usage but that's not a good reason to remove features IMO. They should still be present, they're in Win7 you just have to switch to the classic theme but you can't do that in the latest release. I remember being on the Win8 team when the perf team revealed the results of their testing for Aero UI vs. Metro UI. The difference was more than double in terms of watts used on Intel processors. It was even more dramatic for Atom processors. Since at the time, there was a company wide drive to be more power usage aware, the die was cast.

'Not duty of government to bail ADCs from financial crunch': Meghalaya Deputy CM Stating that the Government cannot provide any kind of financial assistance to help the ADCs in the payment of the salaries, he said that it is the job of the District councils to pay the salaries from its own resources. Meghalaya Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong. (File Photo) Meghalaya Deputy Minister, Prestone Tynsong has clarified that it is not the duty of the State Government to bail out the three Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) who are facing severe financial crunch. "The ADCs are separate entities and it is not under the State Government. As per agreement, which was arrived long time back, the responsibility of the government was to release the outstanding dues of the share from royalties on the mineral sources to the three ADCs," Tynsong told reporters here today. The Deputy CM also informed that the Government had recently released an amount of ₹ 45 crore from which was sanctioned by the 15th Finance Commission under the special plan assistance. Tynsong stated that out of the ₹ 45 crore which was released, the total amount of funds which was allocated to the three ADCs include KHADC (₹ 20.47 crore), GHADC (₹ 18.20 crore) and JHADC (₹ 6.82 crore). Earlier, the District Council Affairs Minister, Lahkmen Rymbui had stated that the funds which were released are meant for various developmental activities as per plans and estimates proposed by the three ADCs.

University of Central Florida psychology doctoral student Julia Wright agrees, noting that we show others how we want to be treated in the way we conduct ourselves and the way we dress. As an older graduate student returning to school after a 25-year career as a product design engineer, Wright notes that dressing appropriately is more important than many students think. "You should not look like you just rolled out of bed or that you're ready to go play volleyball at the beach," she says. It's also about being engaged in the program. "The people I hear complain about being treated fairly are those who, when the professor is lecturing or they're part of a group discussion, are sitting there surfing the web on their laptops or texting people on their cellphones." Gutierrez urges students to treat graduate school as their first real entrance into the job market. "People who dress appropriately, who interact with others appropriately, and who carry themselves as professionals are going to get the respect professionals ought to receive," he says. Believe in yourself. Have confidence in your capacity because people can see that, Gutierrez says. But also understand that you don't have to know everything to feel and be competent. "Asking someone with more experience for help is never a bad thing," he notes. "In fact, it demonstrates maturity." Speak up. When someone implies that you're too young or inexperienced, correct them. Point to all you've done to get where you are in your career so far, the research you've completed, the publications you've been involved with, even if you weren't recognized as a co-author, and the experience you do have with the field of psychology. "I think if we all asserted ourselves more — in a respectful way, of course — we could really change people's views," Lima says. "Our silence endorses the status quo." Recognize that it's not you. Kraha says it's important to keep in mind that the disrespect or unfair treatment you may experience is not really about you as a person or what you can and will accomplish. It often stems from a lack of understanding or awareness. "It always helps me to remember that," she says. "What they're saying isn't a reflection on you, it's a reflection on who they are and where they are in their lives." Become an advocate. Gutierrez says it's never too early to get involved in activism. As psychologists and psychology students, we know too much about human behavior not to get involved in advocating for political or social or institutional changes. It can also help you learn more about your institution — and can leave you feeling more empowered. "I'm not saying that everyone has to go out and form a labor union, but if you don't want to feel taken advantage of as a student, get involved in the system and do something about it," he says. n Civilian Psychology Careers CivilianMedicalJobs.com FIND JOBS POST RESUMES APPLY TODAY Army Medicine Civilian Corps employees are NOT subject to military requirements such as "boot camp," enlistments or deployments.

Home Celebrities News 'Is this something that we have just realised?,' asks Sushmita Sen on... 'Is this something that we have just realised?,' asks Sushmita Sen on the existence of nepotism in Bollywood The former Miss Universe made a career in Bollywood on her own in 2000s with movies such as Biwi No 1, Aankhen, Filhaal, Samay, Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya and Main Hoon Na but decided to take a break from acting to focus on her health and raising her daughters Renee and Alisah. Her performance in Aankhen, Filhaal and Samay received critical praise but the films did not do well at the box office at the time of their release. "I always believe I am a satellite hit because whatever work I did when it came on satellite, it became a hit and people started applauding the performance. But back then, when it was in the theatres, it didn't work," the actor told PTI in an interview. Sushmita Sen, 44, believes what kept her strong during those years was a faith in her abilities. "I define my success, I acknowledge my failures but I also acknowledge that I haven't failed, my attempts have. There is a big difference. When people don't know how to differentiate between the two, everybody piles on with the insecurity of being called a failure. That is a very big mistake that people allow others to make on their behalf". The actor says she is "open to criticism" and one can review her "badly" with "some sugar and salt" but she will continue to focus on her work and try to give her best.

Kristen Stewart's mom shooting a transgender prison drama by Kim Grundy Kim Grundy http://twitter.com/KimGrundy Kim's Most Recent Stories These Angelic Baby Names Are Perfect for Your (Let's Hope) Little Angel Top Stretch Mark Creams Moms Swear by During Pregnancy These Boy-Girl Twin Names Are the Perfect Match — & Twice the Cuteness July 26, 2011 at 5:35pm PM EDT Kristen Stewart isn't the only one in her family in the Hollywood biz. Her mother, Jules Stewart, is directing a transgender prison drama that Kristen was supposed to star in… that is, until she dropped out. Related story Kristen Stewart's New Princess Diana Movie Is the One You've Been Waiting For Kristen Stewart's mom, Jules Stewart, is gearing up to direct her first indie film called K-11, about a transsexual prisoner with autism. Kristen was actually going to play the lead role until the busy Twilight actress had to drop out due to sheduling conflicts. Her moms is still keeping the family involved, casting her brother Cameron (pictured below with Kristen in 2008) in small role in the film. "It's just one of those things where you try and get a movie off the ground that's small," Kristen Stewart told MTV about the film. "I don't know [whether it will get made]. Like, right now it's harder [to get indie films made]. It just never got legs. I still really hope to do it." Between the Twilight films and starring in Snow White and the Huntsman, Stewart apparently does not have time to make it. In fact, Kristen is not the only Twilight star that recently backed out of the film. Nikki Reed dropped out of the film after telling MTV in November that she and Kristen have been involved with the movie since 2008. "It's about a little-known section of the men's county jail. I'm playing a man, and Kristen's playing a boy," Reed said. Even though Kristen and Nikki are no longer involved in the film, it will be interesting to see Kristen's older brother, Cameron, making his film debut, even if his role is a small part. The film will star Goran Visnjic (ER), D.B. Sweeney (Hard Ball), Kate del Castillo and Portia Doubleday (Youth in Revolt), with supporting actors Jason Mewes and Tommy "Tiny" Lister.

Arizona public schools have already lost billions in education funding over the past decade as lawmakers have expanded private school vouchers again and again. Ducey Lies to Push Anti-Mask Voucher Programs Ducey's newest voucher program encourages parents "unhappy with their public school district's COVID-19 mitigation efforts" (as in, mask mandates) to apply for $7,000 in federal dollars to take to private schools even if they have mask mandates! Three months after Ducey's anti-mask voucher program was first announced, the Governor's office claimed they'd received more than 2000 applications which exceeded the $10 million in allocated funding. However, these claims about the popularity of the program don't hold up. According to AZ Republic reporter Stacey Barchenger in "The Gaggle" podcast, public records requests revealed that only 1400 voucher applications were started, only 650 were completed and submitted, and only 93 were approved. In short, Gov. Ducey lied about the popularity of these programs. And if history tells us anything, he will double down on this lie in order to sell expansion of the program this upcoming legislative session. The Governor's office claimed they'd received more than 2000 applications which exceeded the $10 million in allocated funding. However, these claims about the popularity of the program don't hold up… In short, Gov. Ducey lied about the popularity of these programs. Unused Voucher Funds Could Help 1.1 Million Students In the interview, Barchenger points out that less than $50,000 has been spent of the $10 million set aside by Ducey for this purpose. The remaining $9.9 million remains unused. As Save Our Schools Arizona Director Beth Lewis recently pointed out in the AZ Republic, "The governor's claims are absolutely misleading. The governor's office is holding $10 million dollars hostage saying they're receiving all these applications, and that money is not in the classroom helping kids right now." Federal dollars that could be used for aides, academic support, counselors, and PPE to keep students, teachers, and staff healthy and in the classroom are sitting in the state's coffers. While touted by the governor to be vastly successful and popular, the program has proven to be the opposite. Barchenger reported that when confronted with the data, Ducey responded that "helping any number of families through what he called 'good policy' was worth it in his mind." For the governor, it's preferable that millions of dollars sit unused in order to justify expanding vouchers at all costs. Voucher Fraud & Abuse Like Arizona's ESA voucher program, the Governor's latest private school voucher plan is rife with misspending. The program was billed as a way to "get kids back into classrooms," yet a full third of approved vouchers are being used to send kids to online school. And despite an income cap meant to prioritize low-income kids, several awarded vouchers went to wealthy families. Barchenger says that her research uncovered several inconsistencies with what the governor said the purpose of the voucher program was and the actual outcomes. "[Ducey] said the programs were to keep kids in classrooms, but a third of the people who have been approved for the vouchers were approved to send their kids to online school so they're not in classrooms at all," she noted. "The language coming from [Ducey's] office was, 'We want to support districts and parents that are following the law," Barchenger reported, referring to the law prohibiting districts from imposing mask mandates that was recently ruled unconstitutional. "But that law doesn't exist anymore, so [Ducey's] shifted a little bit to the latest defense that anything we can do to keep kids in classrooms helps stem the digital divide that has emerged after COVID." And yet many families are using the funds to attend online school. The US Treasury has said federal Covid relief dollars were intended to help with economic recovery and slow down the spread of the virus, and that Ducey's programs do the opposite. "These programs were unveiled just after the CDC recommended universal masking in schools, and they do the opposite of that. They put financial incentive to districts that don't follow those guidelines," said Barchenger. "[Ducey] said the programs were to keep kids in classrooms, but a third of the people who have been approved for the vouchers were approved to send their kids to online school so they're not in classrooms at all." Stacey Barchenger, AZ Republic Tweet AZ Parents Choose Public Schools The program's failures underscore the well-known fact that private school vouchers are not an effective or efficient way to help Arizona kids in need. Despite this, as well as the ongoing struggle between AZ and the federal government on whether voucher expansion is an appropriate use of federal dollars, Gov. Ducey insists that there will be a need to expand the program. Once again, his office is using lies and exaggerations to expand eligibility, which is extremely concerning when $9.9 million in Covid relief dollars sits unused. Gov. Ducey continues to prioritize unpopular and inefficient voucher programs while Arizona public schools remain last in the nation in education funding. Arizona families overwhelmingly choose public schools, and voters rejected private school voucher expansion by a 2-1 margin in 2018. AZ voters have spoken: Governor Ducey and the legislature must prioritize public education and support the 1.1 million students attending Arizona's public schools.

Photo voltaic solar energy is a clean source of energy with much lower carbon footprint than other sources. However, the vast land requirements of solar energy arrays may make installation impractical when available land is better suited for other purposes. The goal of this research was to investigate changes to the environmental physics, grass production, and grass species diversification under solar panels in an active pasture. To this end, different land characteristics were studied observationally including the length of the growing season, the greenness, the production per acre), and the environmental physical processes.

Farber > Articles > You Like Them But Can They Do the Job? You Like Them But Can They Do the Job? Much has been made in the last few years of a creeping "confirmation bias" when it comes to job interviews. In some cases, a slice of as little as the first 10 seconds of an interview can predict the outcome. It seems that if we like applicants at the start, we spend the interview subconsciously looking for reasons to like them more. If we dislike the candidate, we will use the time finding reasons to support that judgment. The problem is that these judgments are incredibly unreliable when it comes to figuring out whether or not a person can do the job. For any hire, your reputation is on the line, so you should carefully scrutinize the process. One of the best predictors of how a person will perform is previous performance. You can use behavioral interview questions to gain insight into how a candidate has solve problems in the past. This won't be a perfect predictor of traits like collaboration or ability to learn, but it could give you a like-for-like assessment. Questions like "Tell me about a time you…" require candidates to tie past experiences to new scenarios. It's become conventional wisdom that extroverts will tend to do better in an interview than introverts, but that isn't always the case. Extroverts are not always aggressive and introverts are not always meek. Moreover, the idea that these personality tendencies fit certain jobs better than others has been debunked. Behavioral interview questions help you see past the personality to assess whether or not the candidate will be capable of doing the job. Conducting effective interviews does take a good deal of preparation. You need to detail the abilities you're looking for ahead of time and carefully construct the questions so that the responses you get will be measurable. The questions you ask should be carefully correlated to the competencies you're looking for. It's a good idea to create a rubric or scorecard in advance as well. This will give you a reference point as to what you're looking for and allow you to make notes during the interview. It helps you look past the personality. Once all of the interviews are over, you can enter the information into a spreadsheet and calculate the results. The spreadsheet will let you grade and rank the candidates, and will enable a more reliable, fact-based decision. When you like a particular candidate, you have to be careful that the halo effect isn't clouding your judgment. Having a hiring committee of objective individuals is a good way protect against that bias. At the very least, having a second opinion who doesn't just default to what you want to hear will help you let you check your assessment. No one element of an interview gives you a perfect prediction of a candidate's success. Effective interviews will blend a number of the strategies such as assessing past work experiences and measuring cognitive ability to get a fuller picture of a candidate's abilities. Matching those abilities to the competencies you need in your team is the key to determining whether or not they will be able to do their job. It's a difficult task, and you're not going to be right 100% of the time, but your professional reputation, maybe even your career, require that you get it right as often as possible.

Olinger, Papineau Join WVU Golf November 12, 2015 by The Original Golf Blogger Duo to Join WVU Golf MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (November 11, 2015) – West Virginia University golf coach Sean Covich announced Wednesday that Ty Olinger (Blacksburg, Va.,/North Cross HS) and Etienne Papineau (St-Jean sur Richelieu, Quebec/Champlain St-Lawrence) have committed to joining the Mountaineers starting in the fall of 2016. "We are really excited to be adding these two young men to our program," said Covich, who is currently guiding the Mountaineers through their first varsity season in over 30 years. "This will be our third recruiting class and we are in a great spot. Luckily we have balance on our roster with each class and are able to bring in two strong players for next year trying to replace our seniors, Easton Renwick and Mason Short." Olinger, who hails from Blacksburg, Virginia, currently competes for Richard Cook at North Cross School. He ranks as the No. 2 senior and the No. 4 player in the state of Virginia, ranking No. 155 nationally for the class of 2016. Olinger earned VISAA First Team All-State accolades from 2012-15 and was the Roanoke Metro Player of the Year in 2014. He has earned mention on the All-Metro Team on five occasions. Olinger finished as the runner-up at the VISAA State Tournament in 2013 and 2014 and was the VISAA State Tournament runner-up in 2015. He boasts a pair of titles at the Roanoke Valley Golf Hall of Fame Junior Championship and boasts top-20 finishes at the 2012 Scott Robertson Memorial (6th), 2013 Virginia Junior Stroke Play Championship (8th), 2015 AJGA Junior at Owensboro (9th), 2014 Virginia Junior Stroke Play Championship (10th), 2015 AJGA Philadelphia Junior (13th), 63rd Virginia Junior Stroke Play Championship (14th) and the 25th Virginia Junior Match Play Championship (20th). "I look forward to getting Ty around our guys and having him compete," said Covich. "He's a talented player who's continued to improve the past few years. I'm excited about his potential." The son of Danny and April Olinger, Olinger intends to major in business management. He chose West Virginia over Elon, Radford and Seton Hall. Papineau, a native of St-Jean sur Richelieu, Quebec, Canada; plays for Champlain St-Lawrence. He played in three National Collegiate Championships, posting a scoring average of 70.5. Papineau won the title at the 2015 event, scoring 10 under par for the win and also earned medalist honors at the conference championship. He earned All-Canadian honors in 2015 and was named to the all-star team in 2014 and 2015. Papineau helped the Lions to the runner-up spot at the conference championship in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and was a member of the squad that set an all-time low round score of 284.

White Bears bounced back from their disappointment at IMKA to record a solid four set win against Onyx that leaves all four teams that have played twice so far this season tied in top spot in the league table with one win and one loss each. The two unbeaten sides, Rebels and Inter don't meet until early in New Year so the division looks like enthralling London volleyball for months to come. The first set of their match against Onyx was an exciting one, a tiny lead changing hands several times until the score reached 9:all when Onyx opened up a two point lead and looked to have the set safe at 18:20 However, a good move saved set point and accurate serving from J Forester and a front line of H Ridge, Rosie Kirk and Annie Tinker combining well stunned all watching. From 5:all in the second, Bears were able to raise their game but, after looking comfortable at 14:10 were hit by an Onyx revival in which they closed to 14:12 before, very slowly in an excellent passage of play, tied the score at 17:all. Hannah Robinson, who had come on as a sub two-thirds through the first set, rotated to serve and saved the moment. Earlier in the set she had served just once. this time she put in the three accurate blows that were needed. Onyx's Joana Silva who had come on at 7:10 in the second set and served well, started the third in Position One and, with Jana Parmova, Kara Conway and Daisy Moya impressive at the net, raced to a 0:5 lead that set them up for the set. Bears settled and the remainder of the play was close and exciting but the visitors kept themselves in front. At 13:17 they secured side out and it was Joana's turn to serve again. That opening line up proved decisive and the match was saved. Play was close to 6:all in the fourth after which Bears raced to 5:12 and 6:14. A time-out was called at each score and the second once settled Onyx. However, the damage had been done and the scoreboard ticked over remorselessly until William Perugini's final whistle. Starting Six: J Forester, Rebecca Jones, Rosie Kirk, Rebecca Rankin, H Ridge, Annie Tinker. Libero: Monika Czesna, P Simonte. Other players: Hannah Robinson, L Tanita.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of retinoic acid receptor-α and promyelocytic leukemia rearrangements: Detection of the t(15;17) translocation in the diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia Academic Article Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15 Gene Rearrangement Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute Receptors, Retinoic Acid Translocation, Genetic Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized cytogenetically by a balanced reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(15;17) (q22;q21). This translocation involves the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha) on chromosome 17 and the promyelocytic leukemia locus (PML) on chromosome 15 and results in the transcription of novel fusion messenger RNAs. In this study, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was applied to the detection of the t(15;17) translocation in twenty-six clinical specimens cytologically diagnosed by French-American-British criteria as APL. This technique could readily be applied to both fresh and nonviably frozen tumor samples. In 24 of 26 samples, rearrangements of the PML and RAR-alpha, loci could be detected by Southern blotting after digestion with MluI and BssHII. Furthermore, co-migration of the rearranged fragments, detected by hybridization to probes for the PML and RAR-alpha genes, demonstrated that these loci were juxtaposed. The translocation was detected in specimens at the time of initial diagnosis, on differentiation therapy with retinoic acid and at the time of relapse. The diagnostic accuracy was compared to cytogenetics and the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the novel PML-RAR-alpha fusion transcript. The samples from two patients were negative by all three diagnostic methods, and both of these patients failed to respond to all-trans retinoic acid. In the other 24 APL samples, cytogenetics was positive in only 76.9% of the cases, whereas both reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and PFGE methods detected the translocation in 100% of the cases. Thus, PFGE can readily detect the t(15;17) translocation in both viable and nonviable clinical specimens and can improve the diagnostic accuracy of morphology and cytogenetics in APL. In contrast to conventional electrophoresis based on rearrangement of RAR-alpha, the ability to demonstrate directly co-migration of the PML and RAR-alpha loci enables this method to distinguish the t(15;17) translocation from variant translocations such as the t(11;15). Because PFGE can be performed on nonviable, frozen tumor samples, it could be diagnostically useful in APL when the RNA-based reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction cannot be performed.

Here's some photos of the makeshift street memorial for Juan Jerez, a 15-year-old Bedford Park resident gunned down last Friday night on the corner of Minerva Place and Creston Avenue. Yesterday more than 20 of Jerez's friends gathered around the memorial, which they placed at the site of his death. They all said that the shooting was accidental and that Jerez was an innocent victim. He was shot while playing basketball, they said. An unidentified 15-year-old companion of Jerez was also shot once in the right leg, but will survive. The police arrested Daikwan Giles, 17, a suspect, in connection with the shootings. According to police, Giles also lived in the neighborhood. Hope giles get life in prison ! why would you hope he gets life in prison, if youre not sure if he even did it shutup. RIP JUAN GONE BUT NEVER FORGOTTON! THEY KILLED AN INNOCENT KID.

The High Qualification Commission of Judges continues holding interviews with candidates for the new Supreme Court until May 26, 2017. As of May 11th, panels of the HQCJ interviewed 55 candidates with negative opinions from the Public Integrity Council, of which 42 negative opinions were neglected. Decision on recommendation of these candidates for appointment as judges will be adopted by HQCJ: 11 of 16 votes of members of the Commission are required to adopt positive decision. Decision of HQCJ on final list of candidates to the Supreme Court shall be taken behind closed doors by secret voting. This gives HQCJ members an opportunity to approve notorious candidates and hide behind collective irresponsibility. The Commission also failed to provide for publication of personalized results of voting for adoption/disregarding of conclusion of the Public Integrity Council. Without this the public have limited information to access whether decisions were fair. Amendments to the Rules of procedure of the Commission need to be adopted to provide for publication of both individual scores that each member gave to each candidate and personalized results of votes on consideration of opinions of Public Integrity Council. Please see the statement of the Reanimation Package of Reforms for more details.
Figure-lyricism–dream COSTAS Joachim has an exhibition at the Alpha Gallery, Nicosia. Joachim was born in 1936 in Bellapais, Kyrenia. He studied painting at the Bath Academy of Art at the Unversity of Bristol in England and the Athens School of Fine Arts. His works can be found at the Cyprus Museum of Modern Art and at the National Gallery of Greece, in the collections of the Presidential Palace, the Ministry of Education and Culture and the Archbishopric in Cyprus, at the office of UNESCO in Paris, and in many private collections including that of Takis Ioannou. He is one of the seven founding members of the Cyprus Chamber of Fine Arts (EKATE) in 1966. In 2003, 2004 and 2006 his lifetime achievements and contributions to the culture of Cyprus were recognised with awards from the President of the Republic. He says that in his latest work of paintings he is concerned with themes that he created before 1974. They developed into paintings from drawings and studies in colour. They date from a period of intense creativity inspired at Bellapais Studio by the idyllic countryside of Bellapais. Colourful compositions in-clude figures, which have been characterised as swirling flowing free studies of movement in forms and colours, giving wonderful poetic dreamlike statements. Figure compositions in a more sensitive, lucid approach, blending associated colours, thus luring the spectator into the aesthetic interaction. The combination of the experiences into a non-representational context with graphic symbols is a gift. Although the study of the artist may have been done on a different level he may select and digest the experience to his own terms and his personally created forms. Costas says: "In my artistic explorations, I study the numerous analogies that refer to space within the picture, to the line and to the form, as they exist as we see them, as they themselves as shapes have an impact on us. "And then, while they are translated and transferred to the canvas, they are transformed, condensed and abstracted towards the basic concepts. This is a continuous 'dialogue' with the white surface of the canvas."

»Bolton receives second round of funding from National Geographic Society Submitted by Debra J. Bolton Debra Bolton, National Geographic Society Explorer and director of intercultural learning and academic success in the Department of Diversity and Multicultural Student Affairs, has earned a second round of funding from the National Geographic Society in Washington, D.C. Bolton focuses on promoting STEM subjects, targeting females of color, by teaching introductory classes to high school students living in Garden City. Initial funding enabled the four-week courses that she calls "Girl Power GIS." The 2017 funding also helped a school teacher create an after-school Geography Club at Bernadine Sitts Intermediate Center and the high school's physics teacher to present a course on wind power. All of these activities were in the Garden City School District. The current award from National Geographic Society funded "Creating a Pathway to STEM for Females of Color." New funding paves the way for Bolton to "take her show on the road" by presenting her strategies, learning/teaching techniques, and long-term outcomes of the project at two national meetings later this calendar year. The current funding also helps Bolton continue a popular public radio program called, "Silver Rails: Music of the World in the Folk Tradition." During Geography Awareness Week in mid-November, the two-hour program features music that matches the annual theme for the week. Geography Awareness Week-related programming on High Plains Public Radio in western Kansas and the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles began eight years ago and features daily modules with geography tidbits, called, "Did You Know?" Recently, an additional cohort of funding for "Girl Power GIS" came from a K-State Center for Engagement and Community Development Engagement Incentive Grant. The next Girl Power GIS class takes place in April 2019 in Garden City. Bolton began her relationship with the iconic National Geographic Society, first, as a policy point person and Grosvenor Scholar of the Kansas Geographic Alliance, based at Kansas State University and Fort Hays State University. A policy point person advocates, legislatively, for raising classroom standards in geography that go beyond the simple "embedding" the subject in other courses. Bolton worked for K-State Research and Extension as a specialist based at the Southwest Research Extension Center in Garden City for 13 years before becoming director of intercultural learning on campus.

Well done to Matt England and Dan Hiscock for winning their level doubles match against Wiltshire's no 2's , to Ellie Slawin and Ellie Gardener for also winning their level doubles game against Wiltshire's third pair and to Will Perry and Ellie Gardener for winning their mixed match in two straight games. Somerset was unlucky not to win more with another 11 matches played between the two counties going to three games. There were many excellent rallies played between the two counties with good attacking play from Somerset, good use of tactics to provide opportunities to attack opponents, and moving opponents out of position to create openings for winning shots. We play our last match of the season next weekend when we host Jersey at Westlands Sports Centre on the Saturday and Sunday and will be celebrating with a social event on the Saturday after the match. The match on Saturday is 3-5pm with skittles and food from 5-7pm and Sunday is 10-1pm; we look forward to seeing as many of you as possible.
Am I Maximizing all Available Tax Deductions for my Family? In Canada if your income exceeds $200,000 you have graduated to the highest federal tax bracket. Congratulations! In many provinces this brings your marginal tax rate close to or over 50%. That means for every dollar earned in excess of $200,000 you will be paying a substantial portion to the Canada Revenue Agency. With this in mind it is important to ensure that you are minimizing your family's personal tax bill. How can your family reduce their taxes? It can be as simple as stepping back and thinking about which credits, and deductions may be applicable to you. Do I have employment income? Did I incur any significant medical expenses this year? Did I relocate for employment? Did I contribute to my RRSP? Did I have any investment income? Did I donate to charity? Did I get tuition credits? Did I buy a house this year? Are my spouse and I in significantly different tax brackets? Do I use public transit? Am I maximizing my deductions from self-employment income? All of these questions can pin point additional tax savings for your family. Below we have outlined some commonly missed deductions and planning opportunities which can save your family money come tax time. Does your insurance company only pay for a portion of your medical expenses? If so the part that you pay out of pocket is likely tax-deductible. Examples of frequently missed medical expenses are prescription eye glasses & contacts, prescriptions not reimbursed, and employee paid premiums to a private health services plan. Are you taking public transit to work? This can be a tax deductible expense. To be eligible you need to demonstrate that your transit pass meets the criteria set out by the CRA. Did you contribute to your RRSP? You may want to think about using the deduction in the current year or deferring it to higher income years. If you direct the refund from your deduction contribution to your TFSA this could be a great form of forced savings. On the other hand, deferring the deduction to higher tax years may also be a good strategy for you. If I am self-employed am I keeping proper track of my expenses? As a self-employed individual you are eligible to write-off many of your business expenses. Often times additional tax dollars are paid as a result of poor record keeping. Start a system this year to organize your business receipts making it easier and more efficient come tax time. Would a spousal loan strategy help? If you and your spouse are in vastly different tax brackets this strategy could benefit you depending on your level of investment assets. With a spousal loan any income earned on the loan would be taxed in the hands of the lower income spouse. Does an inter-vivos trust make sense for my family? At a certain level of assets an inter-vivos trust could provide your family tax savings. This is done by allocating income out to beneficiaries who are in a lower tax bracket. Inter-vivos trusts are especially useful to fund a child's education once the RESP has been maximized. Could an IPP benefit you? For individuals over 40 with their own businesses, consider setting up an individual pension plan could offer pre-tax business savings, higher contribution room for individuals vs RRSP's, not to mention the deductibility of fees and set-up costs. Tax legislation evolves in our dynamic political environment, and eligible deductions and credits are subject to change. A qualified tax professional can help you identify which are applicable to you and also provide guidance and planning suggestions to make the most of the strategies available to reduce your future tax bill. By paying fewer taxes, your family will benefit from having more money to achieve their financial goals.

Living with a chronic illness is hard all year round. During the holiday season it causes unique extra challenges. I knew nothing about this before I became chronically ill myself. I have had many years now living with ME/CFS, some holiday seasons moderately affected and some ruined. ME stands for myalgic encephalomyelitis. CFS stands for the ludicrous name of chronic fatigue syndrome. But that's another story. Chances are someone you love is saddled with a chronic illness. There are lots of these illnesses. Arthritis, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, many cancers, fibromyalgia, diabetes, IBS, celiac disease, heart conditions, lupus, neurological disorders, are just a few. Many of these are invisible illnesses, that is, the person may look fine. They may look downright great. But the person who is chronically ill deals with many struggles in ways you may not be able to imagine. Sometimes a lack of energy can be like a lead balloon that hampers everything you can think of, and plenty that never occurred to you. Would this person you care for like to do some gift shopping? Maybe. But maybe they can't manage the crowds, stores and lists on their own. Or maybe they can't make it out of the house — possibly out of their beds — at all. Pain can leave a nasty boot print on all activities. Does the person you care about need help with buttons or tying their shoes? If you can offer before they have to ask, or before they struggle through the ordeal, life is easier. Does it hurt them to open a car door? Get to that door first, and open the way. Try to think ahead and be prepared to bridge the gap to protect their fragility. And always feel free to ask if something is hard for them, your concern will be appreciated. For some, mental fog, which makes it difficult to think or remember things, is a crippling symptom. Some may find it hard at times to talk, or to understand what is being said. If you can do the talking and take charge at the store counter, you could make the difference between them being able to go out or not. This is such a lovely way of expressing just how hard it is for someone who is chronically sick. I just gave up years ago of trying to explain to my family [I don't have friends any more] how difficult it can be for me to make arrangements in advance to go anywhere only to have to cancel because I'm just not up to it. They don't understand how stress can upset my whole body- and mind. When things get too much and I burst into tears they can't understand that it's not because I'm weak it's because I've taken too much on. Emotional Lability can just overcome me and I cry. They lose their temper which just makes things worse. I hate being sick and am tired of it. If you have a strong body it's impossible to imagine how hard it is when you're so ill and yet look OK. Thanks for this- I might just try and bring it to their attention. I do indeed know how that can be when you're so exhausted everything falls apart and nothing is possible. I'm sorry your family doesn't understand. Perhaps the day will come when they will. I'm glad you liked my article, it is a difficult topic to present in a way that people can receive it.

Twitter merger and acquisition rumours rampant 10 Feb 201161 Views Companies such as Facebook and Google are showing a growing interest in purchasing Twitter with an estimated valuation of $8bn to $10bn. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Google Inc, Facebook Inc and other companies have held meetings with Twitter, discussing the possible acquisition of the company. The company had estimated revenue of $100m and $110m in 2011. Twitter only made revenue of $45m in 2010 due to expenditure on hiring and data centre. Co-founder of Twitter, Evan Williams, and Dick Costolo, the chief executive, have both previously sold companies to Google. A Twitter spokesman however, refused to discuss its finances or the valuations and interest by other companies. Google and Facebook also remained quiet on the subject. Twitter, which was created in 2006, has 200m users and only introduced advertising last year. Promoted Trends, a new Twitter ad service, has been selling out its inventory every day. Ethan Kurzweil of venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners stated, "Are these prices justifiable based on financial multiples? No." He also added, "But these start-ups are building social services and have lots of data about their users" and "the market is valuing that mightily right now." Public offering has become increasing popular, with the internet music service Pandora Media Inc planning a $100m public offering. These high valuations have sparked other start-ups to explore public offerings. The recent offering of $315m by AOL to purchase The Huffington Post, along with the previous successes of online start-ups such as Facebook and Groupon Inc, have given hope to Twitter, with hopes of transforming into a $100bn company. Debra Aho Williamson, an eMarketer analyst, commented on Twitter's success with advertising. "The company is having great ad-sales momentum right now, but we still think they need to do something big to increase usage and get more people seeing and interacting with tweets. "Most of their advertisers are just experimenting at this point; the challenge will be to get those advertisers to come back and buy more," she said.

The rustic office even features a cheerful lounge area with an exposed brick wall, colorful decor and a foosball table. This office was designed to optimize a comforting design that centers around nature and accommodates the evolving habits and environments in today's workplace.
Daily coffee doesn't affect cancer risk, according to new research from QIMR Home / Daily coffee doesn't affect cancer risk, according to new research from QIMR Researchers from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute have found that drinking coffee does not change a person's risk of being diagnosed with, or dying from, cancer, in a study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology. The large Mendelian randomisation study looked at data from more than 300,000 people and showed that drinking coffee every day neither reduced nor increased a person's risk of developing any cancer. Coffee contains a complex mixture of bioactive ingredients, including substances such as caffeine and kahweol, which have been shown to display antitumour effects in animal studies. However, its potential anticancer effect on humans has not been established, with studies to date producing conflicting findings for overall cancer risk and for individual cancers such as breast and prostate cancers. The QIMR Berghofer study used cancer data drawn from the UK Biobank cohort for more than 46,000 people who had been diagnosed with most invasive cancer types, including about 7,000 people who died from the disease. Senior author, QIMR's Associate Professor Stuart MacGregor said "Our two-pronged research looked at whether cancer rates differed among people with different levels of self-reported coffee consumption, and whether the same trend was seen when we replaced self-reported consumption with genetic predisposition towards coffee consumption. We found there was no real relationship between how many cups of coffee a person had a day and if they developed any particular cancers." "The study also ruled out a link between coffee intake and dying from the disease," he said. The genetic and preference information from the people with cancer was compared with data from more than 270,000 others who had never been diagnosed with cancer. QIMR Berghofer lead researcher, Jue-Sheng Ong, said the study also looked at some common individual cancers such as breast, ovarian, lung and prostate cancers and found drinking coffee did not increase or decrease their incidence. "There was some inconclusive evidence about colorectal cancer, where those who reported drinking a lot of coffee had a slightly lower risk of developing cancer, but conversely examination of data from those people with a higher genetic predisposition to drink more coffee seemed to indicate a greater risk of developing the disease. The disparity in those findings would suggest more research is needed to clarify if there is any relationship between colorectal cancer and coffee" Mr Ong said. Associate Professor MacGregor said the study had implications for public health messaging around the world. "The health benefits of coffee have been argued for a long time, but this research shows simply changing your coffee consumption isn't an effective way of protecting yourself from cancer," he said
Welcome to THE UNWAVERING "The movement dedicated to educating & empowering the brave men & women who have or are still serving our great nation." Join our team as we interview fellow service members, industry leaders and experts on topics such as tuition assistance, networking, VA home loans, filing for disability and much, much more. By sharing resources, benefits and opportunities with you and your families we hope to build a community that inspires one another to REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. Kevin Barba Founder, The Unwavering. Kevin has served as a Quality Assurance Inspector at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory since July 2018, leading a cross-functional team of Hardware Quality Assurance representatives on various research and development projects. Prior to that, he served in the United States Marine Corps from August 2010 to August 2018 as an Avionics Technician, Communications Security Assistant and Quality Assurance Inspector. His tours of duty include Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 465 (HMH-465), Third Marine Aircraft Wing (3d MAW), & Marine Helicopter Squadron 1 (HMX-1). Gerard Garcia Co-Host, The Unwavering Podcast. Gerard served as a Quality Assurance Inspector & NASA Instructor from January 2017 to May 2019. Prior to that he served as a Quality Assurance Inspector with the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) from April 2016 to January 2017. As a 7-year veteran of the United States Air Force, Gerard has played an integral role in military aviation & manned flight missions on C-17 & C-5 aircraft from September 2008 to February 2016. His tours of duty include the 62nd Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (62nd AMXS), 8th Expeditionary Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (8th EAMS) – Det 1, & 721st Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (721st AMXS). When we first started this project in March of 2019, our mission was simple: Pay it forward and give service members as well as their families the tools necessary to be successful both in their personal and professional lives. Yes, our vision is ambitious, but we want to give you more than helpful links or inspirational stories. We want to bridge the gap between the military and civilian community. We can begin to reach our full potential by educating by those around us about the wisdom and experience we as military members bring to the job market or education system. Even though the gap between the military and civilian community may never be completely eliminated, we can begin to narrow the gap by learning from each other. Each and every one of you has made incredible sacrifices during your time in the service that many outside of our ranks will never truly comprehend. It is time you have a community that supports you not just while you are on active duty, but well after you hang up your uniform. Why is this so important to us? Gerard and I would not be sitting here today speaking with you if it was not for our time in the service or the friends and family who supported us along the way. Although the two of us served in separate branches for different lengths of time and were assigned completely different roles in the military, we both had the unique opportunity to serve others. Many of you who have joined this movement or are listening to us for the first time have contributed more than anyone outside of our community could ever imagine. You signed a contract, not to be a professional athlete, actor or musician, making millions of dollars a year, but to sacrifice so that others would not have too.

Q: Slot machine TimeLine animation not working I am trying to develop a slot machine reel application. I have a custom reel pane which adds children vertically. When a spin button is clicked children have to move and when the last child reaches a boundary it has to shift its position above the first child. What I did is shown below. public class ReelPane extends Pane { Timeline timeline = new Timeline(); @Override protected void layoutChildren() { List<Node> managed = getChildren(); double y = 0; for (Node node : managed) { node.setLayoutX(0); node.setLayoutY(y); y += node.getBoundsInLocal().getHeight(); } } public void spin() { List<Node> managed = getChildren(); double dy = 4; for (Node node : managed) { timeline.getKeyFrames().addAll(new KeyFrame(Duration.millis(2000),new KeyValue(node.layoutYProperty(),node.getLayoutY()+dy))); if(node.getLayoutY()>=600){ node.setLayoutY(-50); } } timeline.setCycleCount(Timeline.INDEFINITE); timeline.play(); } } fxml file <?import javafx.scene.control.Button?> <?import javafx.scene.image.*?> <?import javafx.scene.layout.Pane?> <?import sample.ReelPane?> <Pane stylesheets="@css/slot.css" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx" fx:controller="sample.Controller"> <ReelPane fx:id="reel" styleClass="container"> <ImageView fitHeight="100" fitWidth="100"> <Image url="/sample/resources/apple.png"/> </ImageView> <ImageView fitHeight="100" fitWidth="100"> <Image url="/sample/resources/diamond.png"/> </ImageView> <ImageView fitHeight="100" fitWidth="100"> <Image url="/sample/resources/glass.png"/> </ImageView> <ImageView fitHeight="100" fitWidth="100"> <Image url="/sample/resources/grape.png"/> </ImageView> <ImageView fitHeight="100" fitWidth="100"> <Image url="/sample/resources/star.png"/> </ImageView> </ReelPane> <Button fx:id="spin" text="SPIN"/> </Pane> controller package sample; import javafx.fxml.FXML; import javafx.scene.control.Button; public class Controller { @FXML ReelPane reel; @FXML Button spin; public void initialize() { spin.setOnAction(event -> reel.spin()); } } main package sample; import javafx.application.Application; import javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader; import javafx.scene.Parent; import javafx.scene.Scene; import javafx.stage.Stage; public class Main extends Application { @Override public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception { Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource("resources/fxml/slot.fxml")); primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(root, 400, 900)); primaryStage.show(); } public static void main(String[] args) { launch(args); } } But the children are not moving when button is clicked.Can someone tell what went wrong? A: All of the KeyFrames of your Timeline are scheduled at the same time. Furthermore the if statement is executed before you even start the animation. Imho it's easier to put all the elements in a VBox and simply repeatedly change translateY repeatedly from a negative value equal to the element height to 0 and move the last element to the front at the end of the cycle. You may want to apply a clip to the parent of the VBox though to hide anything exceeding the bounds of a single element. @Override public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception { VBox pane = new VBox(); Pane parent = new Pane(pane); parent.setPrefSize(50, 50); parent.setMinSize(Region.USE_PREF_SIZE, Region.USE_PREF_SIZE); parent.setMaxSize(Region.USE_PREF_SIZE, Region.USE_PREF_SIZE); Timeline timeline = new Timeline(new KeyFrame(Duration.ZERO, new KeyValue(pane.translateYProperty(), -50d)), new KeyFrame(Duration.seconds(2), evt -> { pane.getChildren().get(pane.getChildren().size() - 1).toBack(); }, new KeyValue(pane.translateYProperty(), 0d))); timeline.setCycleCount(Animation.INDEFINITE); for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) { Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(50, 50, Color.RED.interpolate(Color.BLACK, i / 6d)); pane.getChildren().add(rect); } parent.setClip(new Rectangle(50, 50)); timeline.play(); Scene scene = new Scene(new StackPane(parent), 200, 200); primaryStage.setScene(scene); primaryStage.show(); } A: A much simpler tool for the needed animation is PauseTransition. If you do not want to specify the layout in the fxml you can override layoutChildren() as you did but you'll need to disable automatic layout (layoutChildren()) so the animation can change positions: import java.util.List; import javafx.animation.PauseTransition; import javafx.scene.Node; import javafx.scene.layout.Pane; import javafx.util.Duration; public class ReelPane extends Pane { private List<Node> managed; private double dy, numberOfCchildren; private boolean isAnimating = false; private static final double PAUSE = 1; @Override protected void layoutChildren() { if(isAnimating) return; managed = getChildren(); numberOfCchildren = managed.size(); double y = 0; for (Node node : managed) { node.setLayoutX(0); node.setLayoutY(y); dy = Math.max(dy, node.getBoundsInLocal().getHeight()); //dy stores the highest y += dy; } } public void spin() { isAnimating = true; PauseTransition pause = new PauseTransition(Duration.seconds(PAUSE)); pause.setOnFinished(event ->{ for (Node node : managed) { if(node.getLayoutY()>= (numberOfCchildren -1) * dy){ node.setLayoutY(-dy); } node.setLayoutY(node.getLayoutY() +dy); } pause.play(); }); pause.play(); } } Consider disabling the button while spinning: import javafx.fxml.FXML; import javafx.scene.control.Button; public class Controller { @FXML ReelPane reel; @FXML Button spin; public void initialize() { spin.setOnAction(event -> { reel.spin(); spin.setDisable(true); }); } } To make the code mre here is the slot.fxml using publicly available resources: <?import javafx.scene.control.Button?> <?import javafx.scene.image.*?> <?import javafx.scene.layout.Pane?> <?import fx_tests.ReelPane?> <Pane xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx" fx:controller="fx_tests.sample.Controller"> <ReelPane fx:id="reel"> <ImageView fitHeight="100" fitWidth="100"> <Image url="https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/softwaredemo/PNG/128x128/Box_Green.png"/> </ImageView> <ImageView fitHeight="100" fitWidth="100" > <Image url="https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/softwaredemo/PNG/128x128/Box_Red.png"/> </ImageView> <ImageView fitHeight="100" fitWidth="100"> <Image url="https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/softwaredemo/PNG/128x128/Box_Yellow.png"/> </ImageView> <ImageView fitHeight="100" fitWidth="100" > <Image url="https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/softwaredemo/PNG/128x128/Box_Blue.png"/> </ImageView> <ImageView fitHeight="100" fitWidth="100"> <Image url="https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/softwaredemo/PNG/128x128/Box_Orange.png"/> </ImageView> </ReelPane> <Button fx:id="spin" text="SPIN" layoutX="20." layoutY="550.0" /> </Pane> A test application: import javafx.application.Application; import javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader; import javafx.scene.Parent; import javafx.scene.Scene; import javafx.stage.Stage; public class Main extends Application { @Override public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception { Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource("slot.fxml")); primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(root, 200, 600)); primaryStage.show(); } public static void main(String[] args) { launch(args); } }

The following movie was made during a neurobionics lab course I taught. NOTE: Loud! Turn down the volume! What can be seen are two robots (the larger one is called "Joschka" and the smaller one is called "Günther"). One is programmed to chase (the "hunter") and the other is programmed to run away (the "prey"). The interesting thing is that they can only sense each other through the sound they are making when they are moving (and through their collision avoidance systems). This is why they stop at regular intervals to listen, otherwise they would get confused by their own motor noise. Avoid obstacles (this always takes precedence). Move toward a sound (hunter) or away from a sound (prey). The idea of the lab course was to show students (mainly biologists, but also computer scientists) how to start with inspiration from nature and get to a technical implementation. I designed and taught this 3-4 day lab course which began with the physical and neurobiological basics of sound localization. Then different algorithms were implemented with Matlab on the PC. On the last day, the behavior of two sound localizing robots had to be programmed (I did the implementation of the sound localization algorithms on the robots myself, as that would have been beyond the scope of the lab course). Scroll down for a description and close-up pictures of the robots. Infineon C164CI microcontroller (Conrad Electronic C-CONTROL II unit). This is the programming language of the C-CONTROL II unit. It is syntactically similar to C, but compiled to bytecode and interpreted in a virtual machine on the C164CI microcontroller. Wheel encoders, IR collision avoidance system (front left / front right), touch sensor, motor current sense, IR communication system. 2 omnidirectional electret condenser microphone capsules, connected to a custom-built preamplifier board. Correlation in the time domain. Microphone preamplifier connected to 2 A/D inputs of microcontroller. Dual delay-line algorithm (detection of phase coincidence in the frequency domain). Spectrum Digital DSK6713 DSP Starter Kit board (Texas Instruments TMS320C6713 digital signal processor). Microphone preamplifier connected to stereo line-in input of DSP board. Communication between C164CI microntroller and DSP board through I²C bus. Günther, the sound source localizing robot. Joschka, the sound source localizing robot.

Joining Forces to Close the Gender Gap in Education dg-unwomened8x6.jpg Director-General Irina Bokova and UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka today seized the occasion of Mobile Learning Week celebrations to present a new programme, "Empowering adolescent girls and young women through education", to UNESCO's Member States, on 24 February 2015. The programme is a joint undertaking by UNESCO, UN Women, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and the World Bank, and will be officially launched at a meeting of the Commission on the Status of Women at UN Headquarters in New York on 10 March. It provides a coordinated and collaborative effort to close the persistent gender gap in education, focusing on two groups that are most at risk of discrimination and exclusion: adolescent girls (10-19 year olds) and young women (20-24 year olds). After warmly welcoming Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka to UNESCO for her first visit, the Director-General told a meeting of Member States that the new programme was based on the shared conviction that "gender equality is the most powerful force we have to build more inclusive, more just, more sustainable societies" and education "a game changer for the empowerment of girls and women." It will be rolled out gradually in 20 nations where the education gender gap is most critical, and will concentrate on four areas: improving quality and relevance of education; raising awareness at all levels to create a favourable environment for gender equality; strengthening links between the health and education sectors; and improving the data base of statistics on gender and education. "By combining our strengths we will be able to act on several levels and accompany these countries to make education a lever for equality between men and women, which in turn will serve as a motor for development" said Irina Bokova. "Our ambition is to make a difference in a different manner, through a crosscutting approach, and putting our competences and efforts together." Noting that gender parity and gender equality have not been achieved by a single country in the world, Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka emphasized that education was the single most effective strategy to empower women and address large gaps in political and economic participation. "By linking health, education and other relevant sectors and creating an enabling environment we want to create new or second chances for young women who have left school or are at risk of leaving school. We want to support the transition from education to the meaningful and fulfilling employment. Together we will apply our expertise and experience to this Programme with the aim to create an empowerment model for young women which can be scaled up and implemented in different national contexts." Both leaders emphasized the strategic contribution of the programme to the post-2015 development agenda. The new programme falls under the framework of the Global Partnership for Girls and Women's Education, launched by UNESCO in 2011. Prior to the meeting with Member States, Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka addressed the official opening of Mobile Learning Week 2015, celebrated this week under the theme of Leveraging technology to empower women and girls.
In 2013 the United Nations General Assembly declared that the 3rd of March every year would be the day of"the adoption of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)", known simply as World Wildlife Day. This day would not only be a great opportunity to celebrate the beauty of the natural world but also to raise awareness of the plight of many species due to wildlife crime. Both plants and animals provide the Earth with everything it needs to make it habitable for people to exist and thrive here, providing oxygen, clean water and food and even primitive tools came from plants and animals, along with clothes. Even fossil fuels have evolved as a result of decaying plant and animal species over billions of years, providing people with energy to give us heat and electrical power. Although there are currently numerous conservation initiatives around the world that promote the importance of large, iconic species such as elephants, tigers and polar bears, World Wildlife Day is about also promoting the importance of smaller species whose significance to the eco-system is often overlooked. Such species include frogs, bats and even crabs amongst numerous others. For example, the Mexican government has recently announced a commitment of $37 million to help to secure the future of the vaquita which is the smallest porpoise in the world. With less than 100 individuals thought to be left in the wild (only a quarter of which are thought to be breeding females), the species is constantly underthreat from the gillnets used by fisherman in the Sea of Cortez in their hunt for totoaba fish. Ultimately this World Wildlife Day, we should all take the time to appreciate the signifcance of wildlife not only in our local areas but also all around the world. Like us, animals are able to use tools to aid their survival, form strong bonds between one another and are able to experience complex emotions including both happiness and pain. We share our world with both animals and plants that quite simply, we cannot live without.
So, if you didn't know, I am an absolute sucker for personality tests – not necessarily because I want to pigeonhole myself but more because feeling understood and understanding other people is high on my list of fun things to do. I love people. I love learning about them, talking to them, seeing what makes them tick- but here's where I get confused – I really dislike socialising in large groups, I need at least a week after a social occasion to recuperate and I can't stand spontaneous outings, I need time to mentally prepare myself before I commit to doing anything social. So what if you're both? That's certainly the way I feel, I love being around people, they don't necessarily drain me but I definitely don't actively seek out social occasions to attend in order to feel connected and a part of things – I'm happy at home in my own company and I rarely feel lonely. So here's where the Outgoing Introvert steps in, not sure where you fit in on the Extrovert / Introvert scale? Maybe you're an Outgoing Introvert too – here are 5 signs of the Outgoing Introvert. 1 – Rich Inner World. You spend a lot of time in your head, you like to mull over conversations and ideas, analysing them and thinking about them in fine detail. Not only this, you like to discuss what you're thinking with trusted individuals and hear their points of view too. 2- You like to put others needs first. You're often thinking of others and how to make them feel comfortable, you like to relate to people and show empathy and let them know that you care. You're compassionate and eager to help people close to you analyse their issues and come to a solution. 3 – Environment is everything. Sometimes you're the chatterbox and the centre of attention, but only when the atmosphere is right. If you're at the gig of your favourite band you might be the life and soul, dancing and singing at the top of your voice, many people think of you as being extroverted, but take you out of that situation and into another crowded place with things going on that don't interest you, then you become the introvert, quiet and a little withdrawn – it's all about the environment. 4 – Shallow friendships won't do. Outgoing Introverts want to get to the nitty-gritty, small talk is not their favourite past time at all and friendship which centres around such a thing is unlikely to endure. Don't discuss where you got your nails done or what the weather is like, talk about the planets, about religion, about dreams and beliefs – friendships centred around intense and imaginative subjects really get the outgoing introvert's mind going. Don't be surprised if your outgoing introvert is a little on the reclusive side occasionally – dropping off the radar for a week or so. Despite being outgoing we're still introverts and that, of course, means regaining energy in our own space and on our own. I definitely need to do this after socialising for long spells – even to the point where I need time away from my close family members to reflect. It's not because I'm fed up of people or that they annoy me, it's just that in order to re-energise I need to evaluate and still my mind for a time. This is difficult to do around other people. Of course, as human beings it's impossible to categorize people definitively – we're complex beings and no one is truly 100% any personality type – just because you feel a certain stack of cognitive functions fits you doesn't mean that you're exactly as that type is described and no single personality type is better than another. You could argue that we're all ambiverts or that because we're all social beings in the grand scheme of things, that we're all extroverts. Wherever you fit on the scale you're an amazing human being and sometimes if you don't fit anywhere, it's because you're supposed to stand out!

January 8, 2020 / 8:11 PM / 14 days ago UPDATE 1-UK's Johnson urges Trump to de-escalate Iran situation (Recasts with White House statement, adds comments on nuclear deal) LONDON/WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed Iranian missile attacks on Wednesday, even as the two leaders separately offered different approaches on how to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The two allied leaders spoke in a call before Trump, in a speech, backed away from any military response toward Tehran in retaliation for the strikes on military bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops, Johnson's spokesman and the White House said. The Iranian strikes came after the United States killed a top Iranian commander in Baghdad last week. Trump said no U.S. troops were killed in Tehran's strikes. Johnson, in the call, urged Trump to de-escalate the situation urgently to avoid further conflict, Johnson's spokesman said. "The two leaders discussed the current situation in the Middle East and agreed to continue close coordination in support of shared national security interests," White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. He gave no other details. Still the leaders, whose countries are close allies, separately backed different approaches to Iran. Johnson told the UK's parliament earlier on Wednesday the 2015 nuclear deal negotiated between Iran and six world powers, including the United States and the United Kingdom, remained the best option to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018 and adopted a "maximum pressure" campaign against Tehran, but Johnson told UK lawmakers the agreement "remains a shell into which we can put substance again." In his remarks at the White House on Wednesday, Trump called the pact negotiated under his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama "very defective." "The time has come for the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China to recognize this reality," Trump said. "They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal - or JCPOA - and we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place."

Here are 10 things we've learned about the Samsung Gear S4 We should have a few busy months ahead of us. Google is working on a new Pixel watch, LG on two intelligent timepieces and with IFA approaching, we're sure there will be some goodies in store from Fitbit, Garmin, Fossil and others. And lets not forget the Apple Watch 4 which is expected to land in September. Not to be left behind, Samsung is reportedly working on the Gear S4 smartwatch. This will be a successor to the Gear S3 launched in 2016 and Gear Sport released last October. The current range is in desperate need for an upgrade, but the wait for the Gear S4 should not be too long. The folks over at SamMobile say Samsung has labelled the new watch with the model number SM-R800 and codename Galileo. Unfortunately, apart this information, they've revealed little else. But other sources have. Here is everything we've learned so far: The Gear S4 could arrive as soon as next month. It is rumoured for release alongside the Galaxy Note 9 at Samsung's Unpacked 2018 event in New York city on August 9th. The early release might give it an edge over products from other companies which are expected from September onwards. Reports say the Gear S4 has already been certified in Europe which points to an imminent release. The watch is expected to have the same round faced design, but it should be thinner and lighter than the S3. This should not be a difficult feat considering the S3 is a pretty chunky animal. Expect the usual upgrades to the processor and memory. The watch looks set to have LTE connectivity. This allows you to leave your smartphone behind while still staying in the loop on messages and calls. So far, LTE watches have been few and far between. The smartwatch is also expected to come with better health and fitness features. The S Health app will be getting more in-depth sleep tracking and possibly more. Some reports even speak of blood pressure monitoring. The company has apparently figured out how to take readings from the wrist. Similar to the way a light sensor is used for measuring heart rate, the new sensor works by shining polarized light and then sensing the intensity of the scattered light. If the technology proves accurate, it means you'll be able to monitor your blood pressure around the clock directly from your smartwatch. A game changer as no one else has managed this so far. We are expecting two variants of the new wearable with a Classic and more rugged, sporty version possibly being revealed. The current Gear S3 includes a 380mAh battery but this will be bumped up to 470mAh. The bigger capacity along with a more efficient processor should extend the 3 days you get on the current generation watch. Rumours are abound that Samsung might ditch its Tizen operating system and swap it with Google's Wear OS. This rumour is from Evan Glass, a tipster with a well known track record. He recently tweeted the following: "Seen on the wrists of Samsung employees: Gear watches running not Tizen, but Wear OS." Some rumours speak of a new name. Instead of Gear S4 the timepiece could be called the Samsung Galaxy Watch. This would make it fit neatly into Samsung's existing range of Galaxy products. Samsung Gear S3 | Image source: Samsung No word yet on pricing but more leaks will surface as August approaches. We'll keep a close eye and let you know when we hear more. Help!

History of Center Academy The History of Center Academy The Beginning of Center Academy Center Academy began in 1968 with the vision of its founder, Dr. Mack Hicks. Seeing the need for a specialized, full-day school for students who were falling through the cracks in traditional schools, Dr. Hicks established one of the first schools in the United States to focus on the needs of students with Attention Deficit Disorder and other neuropsychological processing difficulties. With a team of professionals in the fields of neuropsychology, education, and individualized remediation, Center Academy opened its first classrooms in a small church and then expanded to the Science Center in St. Petersburg, Florida. The school focused on remediating learning disabilities and providing a small, focused, and positive learning environment for students who had experienced academic frustration, and for whom tutoring and other part-time programs were not successful. London Center Academy Opened Center Academy opened a campus in London, England in response to requests by parents and professionals. In the US, the St. Petersburg Center Academy moved to a larger site as the school expanded to meet the needs of more students. It moved to its permanent location in Pinellas Park, FL in 1974, finding a peaceful, 10-acre setting with horses and room to grow. In 1976, Center Academy established a campus in Tampa, FL. Initially, Center Academy worked with elementary students who were struggling with large schools, ineffective teaching methods, or one-size-fits-all approaches to learning. Over the years, the scope of Center Academy expanded to include other students, and in 1984, Center Academy began its high school program. Schools Celebration The Pinellas Park and Tampa schools celebrated their first graduating class in 1987. Center Academy was awarded a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to develop and research the effectiveness of individualized remedial programs for students with a wide range of learning disabilities. While developing these programs, Center Academy provided free evaluations and remediation to over 200 students under the NIMH grant. Newest School As Center Academy has expanded to locations around Florida, it has stayed true to its mission and kept its focus on addressing the unique needs of each student. Center Academy now has 10 schools in Florida. Its newest school in Orlando, FL, opened in August of 2021. Two new campuses will open in the fall of 2023, one in Cape Coral, FL and one in Palm Springs, FL.

Recent Comments "Where Is God When It Hurts?" This book is a gem! Yancey does a great job of using real life examples to show the true purpose and benefit of physical pain and emotional suffering. I think this book could be helpful for anyone going through physical, spiritual or emotional pain or for those that want to support someone in pain. Well researched, well written and well done! Yancey never gives easy answers to tough questions. He never glosses over what you are feeling. This book was a powerful book about the age old question "How can a loving God allow this?"Yancey gives both practical and biblical answers and advice a style which has bad him on of my parents favorite authors. If you are looking for an honest look at this hard question, pick up this book. This book helped me through a large turning point in my life. I've gifted many copies to others. A comforting book to a person of faith experiencing grief. And I salute Yancey's honesty - he asks the hard questions, even when he doesn't have answers.But that's also the problem. He doesn't have answers, other than giving up and choosing to trust God. This book isn't the reason I stopped believing, but it didn't give me strong reasons to keep believing. To be fair, neither did anyone else, and at least Yancey made an effort to look at reality. I was like, "FINALLY! Someone with real feelings." Some people act like super Christians. It was refreshing to see a person write from the perspective of a questioning and afraid Christian. It really is okay to wonder sometimes. This is one of the most powerful books I have been impacted by. I read it shortly after experiencing one of the most devastating losses in my life. I recommend this for anybody who has been, or is, hurting for some interesting perspectives on God's role/place in our lives. Read it in one sitting. Excellent. A contemporary re-visitation of the Problem of Pain. Well done. Yancy feels our pain, even if he doesn't have any particular help for it.Worth re-reading. Fairly deep and balanced viewYancey pulls in multiple sources and types of sources to give the reader a good engagement of the issue of pain and suffering and faithful response. He avoids the easy trap of looking to the afterlife to explain it all away which is common in American Christianity today while still acknowledging the reality of this life's temporary nature. It is well balanced between giving some answers and recognizing that there are no easy answers. This book was okay. There are some good points: about the purpose of physical pain from a biological perspective; how the church body can reach out to those who are suffering. Yancey talks about the hope of heaven after we leave this broken road, yet he does not clearly present the whole Gospel (of our need for redemption through Jesus and Him being the only means of obtaining eternal life with God in heaven). Yancey is a fantastic author and really opens your mind to new ways of thinking about God. This book was very interesting, surprising, and hard to put down until I finished reading it. Then I went back and re-read the pages I had noted with something I wanted to remember. After that, I copied by hand those notes which spoke loudest to me. The beginning of this book was great. Yancey uses the example of leprosy and how dangerous it is to us when we cannot feel pain at the start of the book. I found this fascinating and thought-provoking. But once he got past talking about leprosy and into personal accounts of suffering, I kind of lost interest.

No additional information was immediately released and the incident remains under investigation.
Q: How do I add an XML attribute using DataContract I have a simple class I'm serializing. [DataContract(Name = "Test", Namespace = "")] public class Test { [DataMember(Order = 0, Name = "Text")] public string Text { get; set; } public Test() {} } This kicks out the following XML: <Test> <Text>Text here</Text> </Test> What I want is: <Test> <Text type="MyType">Text here</Text> </Test> How do I add attributes the the XML elements? Thanks in advance. A: Not exactly an answer, but you can try to implement IXmlSerializable to fully control output xml format. A: You can't add attributes to a DataContract. You either have to use a class that Implements ISerializable or use the .Net XmlSerializer. A: I was able to achieve this by declaring an XElement which has attributes defined in it. Ex: public XElement Text { get; set;} A: Add the type attribute with [XMLAttribute] and the element value with [XmlText]. public class Test { public text Text; public Test() { Text = new text(); } [DataContract(Name = "Test", Namespace = "")] public class text { [XmlText] public string Text { get; set; } [XmlAttribute] public string type { get; set; } } }
Leaderboard Submission BIZ – Northwest Louisiana Gatti: While Louisiana sleeps BIZ. Staff A movement is growing across the nation to rebuild our aging roads and bridges. Serious conversations of over a trillion dollars in federal money over the next ten years. President Trump made this promise when he was a candidate and this program is gaining momentum across the nation. Anyone traveling Louisiana's roads and bridges doesn't need to be told our system is in a steep decline. Our system deficits in structure and function are obvious to out of town guests and longtime citizens. These long overdue repairs are necessary. Trump's plan calls for heavy investments by state and local governments for most of the infrastructure spending. It seems to favor those states who have invested recently with streams of revenue dedicated to roads and bridges. States who want to leverage their infrastructure investments are developing streams of revenue to match the requirements of this upcoming program. States that can't or won't invest in this partnership will be left out on the front-end matching funds, but they will be responsible for paying off this new national debt. Being left out is an indefensible position. It's an issue all state legislatures must address, sooner rather than later. This plan comes at a difficult time. Public trust in the legislature is at an all time low- but the legislature is the only body that can prepare Louisiana to participate in Trump's plan. Public distrust was evident last year. The voters instructed the state government to spend transportation taxes on roads and bridges. This measure passed the legislature overwhelmingly and many saw it as a first step in regaining the public trust over wasting transportation dollars. In October 2017 a Constitutional Amendment was passed by voters concerning any new fuel taxes. The fund and its restrictions were set up before any revenue was allocated- this in an of itself of evidence of the distrust of government. The measure required that money in the Construction Subfund be used by the state and local governments for constructing and maintaining transportation infrastructure projects. The new law prohibited money in the Subfund from being used to pay employee wages and retirement benefits. The public spoke loudly by passing this measure that they are fed up with transportation taxes not being used to fix or build new roads and bridges. Anyone surprised by this vote has been living under a rock. Raiding transportation funds for other programs must come to a stop. It was also a clear signal that a "trust but verify" relationship is emerging. Many legislators ran on fixing roads, but public trust must be restored first. This amendment wasn't the entire solution, but it was a clear first step to address the long-term problems of public distrust of government and government's limited role that includes road and bridge repairs. While other states are addressing infrastructure needs, Louisiana has been in a "no holds barred" fight over fractions of pennies. My fear is we will be in the indefensible position of helping payoff the Trump infrastructure plan while not receiving one yard of concrete from the plan. Our ship for roads and bridges is finally coming in, but we will be at the airport fighting over fractions of pennies. We have no plan to make a meaningful leverage of funds for Trump's infrastructure plan. In fact, we have passed no meaningful roads and bridge measures in over 30 years. While the political debate is heated and confusing, we only have five choices in the third special session. Most likely only two could receive the super majority needed for enough legislators to hold their nose and vote. The first option is to renew the entire penny. This would fund the $648 million-dollar budget shortfall created by the lapse of the penny and create an approximately $352 million-dollar surplus. This would receive very few if any votes in either the House or the Senate. This option is dead. The second option is to filibuster or pass nothing. This would result in the temporary one penny sales tax stopping on July 1, 2018. The result would be a projected $648 million-dollar short fall and cuts to non-protected budget items and some protected. Deep cuts across the board would be implemented and the usual scapegoats would be slaughtered- Higher Education, Healthcare, TOPS, Family and Children Services, Department of Corrections, Services for the Disabled, etc. This option doesn't need votes; it just needs one person to take the microphone and filibuster all other ideas. This option is highly unlikely. A third option was presented by Rep. Lance Harris who heads the Republican delegation in the State House in HB 27. This option requested the renewal of a 1/3 penny sales tax. The result on the consumer would be a thirty-three-cent increase in sales tax on a $100.00 purchase. This measure would raise $395 million in new taxes and would result in a $253 million dollar underfunding of the budget passed by the legislature. This underfunding if not addressed with revenue ahead of time, will become a mid-year cut after the budget starts on July 1. A quarter of a billion dollars in foreseeable midyear cuts is not a good message. Foreseeable midyear cuts should be a thing of the past. The fact that the head of the party in the House acknowledged a shortfall between the budget and projected revenue was a wakeup call to me personally. Most think this option would fall well short in the Senate of the 2/3 vote needed. Additionally, this option only received 38 votes in the House with 66 voting against it. The measure needed 70 house votes to pass. The fourth option was outlined in Rep. Leger's bill from the second special session HB 17. This option requested the renewal of ½ penny sales tax. The result to the consumer would be 50 cents increase in new taxes on a $100.00 purchase. The measure would raise $510 million in new taxes and would result in a $138 million dollar underfunding of the budget passed by the legislature. This bill received 32 votes for and 6 votes against in the Senate. In the House, this measure received 63 votes for and 41 against. The measure failed in the house because it needed 70 votes. A fifth option address the shortfall and our need to address roads and bridges. This measure would renew the 1 penny sales tax allocating ½ to the general fund and ½ to roads and bridges. The ½ to the general fund would still result in the $138 million-dollar shortfall addressed under option four above, but it clearly shows our state's willingness to participate in the Trump road and bridge program. This option would provide $510 million dollars a year for over 10 years to address road and bridge repair, preservation, and construction. The sub account would have the same restrictions as the constitutional amendment. The fund would be reviewed quarterly by the Joint Legislative Budget and would be the first account to transition to the Louisiana Checkbook recently passed into law. This option, coupled with new transparency measures, would not only help us move forward in repairing the public trust and repairing our roads and bridges, but also provide a permanent stable solution to our budget problem, our general fund problem, and our infrastructure neglect.

A new study ranks Publix Super Markets as second-to-last when it comes to reducing food waste, earning the chain a "D" grade. The study by the Center for Biological Diversity and the Ugly Fruit and Veggie Campaign rated major U.S. supermarkets based on their accountability in food waste, prevention efforts and recovery and recycling. The highest possible points a supermarket could receive in the study was 50 points, but Publix only received 11. Aldi U.S. was the only chain ranked lower than Lakeland-based Publix, while Walmart held the top spot with a "B" grade and 32 points, following by Ahold Delhaize U.S. with a "C" grade and 26 points and Kroger with a "C" grade and 24 points. Publix has 1,178 stores throughout the southeastern portion of the U.S., with 90,000 employees manning the locations. According to the company's sustainability website, the chain recycled about 270,000 tons of materials last year and has worked with suppliers to cut down on packaging.
Fishermen setting out for the day early in the morning. They will probably catch Snoek, and maybe a little Yellow Tail or Cape Salmon. Muizenberg has always had a very active fishing community, and one of the benefits of living in the Southern part of Cape Town is having a good supply of fresh fish. You can often see the line fishermen fishing on the beach, especially early in the morning and in the late afternoon. Sometimes you see the boats coming in, the smaller boats often landing on the beach, offloading their cargo directly onto the back of bakki's to go off for resale. Driving to work on Strandfontein beach at about 8:00am, I spotted these fishermen taking their small rowing boat out. The boat reminded me of a bygone era of fishing, the days before motors, marine radios and GPS. The sepia effect takes it back in time. You remind me of my childhood day. I grewup in Muizenberg, Our family home use to be on No. 1 Badenpower Drive. My dad Victor Collop worked for Cape City Council as an electrician. My three older brother were fihermen in Muizenberg. Then they had bigger boats four men rowing, on castting the net and the "skipper" Then a fishing crew would be 15 to 20 men. I still remember the owners of the boat the Van Der Pool family and the Skipper was Mr. Ross from Vrygrond. As a boy of 11 years I witness how the boat capsized and how Mr. Ross and two other fishermen drowned. On that day it shoud have been my brothers drowning. One of my brothers Stephen risked his life and saved two men. The following day in the Cape Argus the story appear with a photo of a white man as the hero. Friend, we were forcefully removed from Muizenberg in 1968 and dumped in Parkwood Estate. What a sad day it was. Robert, that is a remarkable and very sad story. A little piece of history. Thank you for sharing it with me.
​This is a recipe full of proteins and packed with just the right amount of spices to treat your tastebuds BUT without adding excessive calories to tip off your balance. Marinate it beforehand and you just need a few minutes to do the rest of it. ​Wash and dry the chicken thoroughly and then mix in all the ingredients for marinade and let it marinate in the freezer for 24 - 48 hours. ​Take out the chicken from the freezer and let it defrost for 4-6 hours until you are ready to cook. ​In a large thick bottomed pan, add olive oil and cook on medium heat. ​Once the oil is hot, add asafetida, immediately add bay leaf, cinnamon stick and caraway seeds. ​Stir for about 10 seconds and then add onions. Cook until onions are translucent and start to turn slightly pink. ​Add marinated chicken and cook on medium-low heat stirring the chicken every 5 minutes. ​Sprinkle additional salt and pepper to taste (if needed). ​Keep stirring and cooking the chicken until all the liquid is dried up. ​Garnish with cilantro and mix well. ​Roti and Rice are certainly traditional options for eating it with (not so if you are eating for weight loss).

When is Black Friday? Black Friday is now under one month away – 25 November to be exact. Considered the biggest day of online spending the world has ever seen, retailers need to be prepared for the surge in demand. How much consumers will spend will be determined by several factors and retailers need to consider their strategies and tactics to acquire a part of the pie. Is Black Friday losing steam? There is recent speculation that for many shoppers the excitement of standing in long lines and sometimes fighting off other shoppers for the best deals is wearing off, with 31% of US shoppers admitting to disliking shopping on Black Friday. In order to quash the potential risk of not achieving revenue targets, traditional retailers are looking to improve their online sales. This is backed up by Deloitte's study that in the build-up to the holidays, shoppers will spend nearly half (47%) of their budget online. To support the increased demand from shoppers, retailers need to ensure they have the functionality and strategies in place in the run-up to Black Friday. Building Engagement – Are your marketing campaigns tailored and targeted? Black Friday is all about getting the best deals and in preparation for 25 November, retailers should consider offering deals which entice consumers to purchase on the day. Is Black Friday More than One Day? While Black Friday might traditionally be one day, retailers can outdo the competition by launching their offers beforehand. Why not have a week of offers? Tempt your customers to purchase your products without the rush of it only being available on one day. You could create your own event before anyone else launches their Black Friday offers, so why not launch Grey Week? Start hitting those revenue targets before your competitors, as well as promoting offers for 25 November to keep customers returning afterwards. Supporting the Demand – Can your platform support the traffic? With such a high volume of shoppers expected to be online during Black Friday (and Cyber Monday too), it is essential to have an infrastructure which can support the number of visitors on the site. It is also vital to have a platform which can cope with processing the high volume of transactions. This is in light of US eCommerce sales reaching $2.72 Billion on Black Friday 2015 – and this is set to increase for 2016. Gathering Audience Insight – Are you able to collect audience information? Visitors to your site offer you the opportunity to gather a plethora of information, providing exclusive insight into their interests, viewing and purchasing habits and engagement with the service. Considering how many visitors will be online this Black Friday, with 39%of US shoppers planning to shop online on Black Friday,no retailer can afford to miss out on collecting this information. Complete Existing Strategies – Are you ready to build recurring revenues? Regardless of the type of retail business you are, the way customers purchase products is changing dramatically. To capitalize on this, retailers are considering how they can generate recurring revenues and looking to other industries who have recognised the opportunity in subscriptions. For all types of retail, a subscription model enables an organization to complement existing sales channels, increase revenue and improve customer engagement. The Honest Company for example, is valued at $1.4 Billion, with 80% of sales coming from its subscription plans. This is where MPP Global's eSuite comes in – an advanced eCommerce platform to manage the complete customer lifecycle to ensure you can maximize conversions, retain existing custom and increase average spend.
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are essential for regulating conformational changes, activities and functions of proteins, and are involved in almost all cellular pathways and processes. Phosphorylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications of proteins, which is related to many activities of life. It can regulate signal transduction, gene expression and cell cycle regulation of many cellular processes by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. With the development and application of proteomics technology, researchers pay close attention on protein phosphorylation research more and more widely. In this paper, we use PSO algorithm to optimize neural network weight coefficients and classify the data which has secondary encoding according to the physical and chemical properties of amino acids for feature extraction. The experimental results compared with the result of the support vector machine (SVM) and experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of PSO-ANNs 2.44 % higher than that of SVM. And this paper at the same time, this paper also analyzes the experimental results under different window values. The results of the experiment are best when the window value is 11.

A Consumer Proposal will be noted on your credit history for two to three years following completion of the Consumer Proposal, depending on the credit bureau. This is the same credit rating impact as traditional or non-profit credit counselling programs and debt management plans, even though these plans require you to pay your debts back in full, compared to partial repayment in most Consumer Proposals. Many people are surprised to learn that transactions credit bureaus consider "negative", such as bouncing payments or a judgment will be shown on your credit history for seven years – this is even longer than a bankruptcy note, which shows on credit history reports for six years following discharge from bankruptcy. Filing a Consumer Proposal does not prevent you from seeking new credit before the Consumer Proposal expires from your credit history report. Even during the time that the Consumer Proposal is noted on your credit history, it may still be possible to obtain new credit, including renewal of ongoing commitments such as your mortgage, financing the purchase of a new vehicle, or even a credit card. Tools and resources to help you rebuild your credit rating and information about actions you can take to improve your credit score are provided as part of the two financial counselling sessions that take place during your Consumer Proposal. It's important to remember that a credit score can change massively in as little as two years depending on your actions. For many people the relatively short-term impact to their credit history and score after a Consumer Proposal filing allows them to gain a financial fresh start and build a strong credit rating faster than if they tried to pay the debt (plus interest) on their own. Watch our short video to learn more about rebuilding your credit after making a Consumer Proposal or filing a personal bankruptcy.

My grasshopper-like spacecraft exploring an atmospherically toxic planet at sunset. When the highly anticipated Hello Games video game No Man's Sky released in 2016 as a Playstation 4 exclusive, fanfair was loud and dreams were big; procedural-generation, a method of creating data according to algorithms instead of manually inputting them, would allow each player to pilot unique spacecrafts and discover unique flora and fauna on unique planets in unique galaxies, theoretically forever… a truly unique feat. NMS was supposed to be so vast, more so than any other game before and after, that even though it was "technically" multiplayer, one may never come across another player. Ever. The curious nature of NMS, the sheer wonder of what one would find if they landed on that distant ringed-planet, is what fueled so much intrigue during the countdown to launch. So who is this audacious Hello Games, a relatively quiet and new company, and why would they embark on a mission of such magnitude? Founded in 2008 in Guildford, England, former employees of other big-time video game companies came together to start over and get back to the fundamentals of creating games. Prior to NMS they specialized in making "indie games," which means they produced games without major funding and support from a larger company like Electronic Arts (one of the places some Hello Games employees left). They did this in part because indie games tend to be more on the creative side and more akin to old-school side-scrolling video games. The other reason, Hello Games only employs 16 people. SIXTEEN. In comparison, EA employs 9,300 people (as of 2018 statistics). Ventures like NMS are thus unheard of for indie game companies because of the massive demand of resources for large scale games, even with a tool like procedural-generation. When gamers invested their $60 towards a brighter future navigating the stars, they were stunned when instead their money went straight into a black hole devoid of happiness. As I told the cashier at my local shop that I was picking up NMS he appropriately quoted the wise Admiral Ackbar. Indeed, sir, it was a trap. It was.The gaming community finally had hands-on experience and found more of a cheeseless moon than an Earth 2.0 or Mars. The excruciatingly simple tasks - traveling to a planet, harvesting some materials, and discovering new flora/fauna - it turns out got incredibly stale. The main storyline felt hollow, simple, and uninspired. It was also too short, something rather unforgivable for a game with such touted spaciousness. One of the saving graces was that tiny, insignificant chance that maybe, potentially you might come across another player out in the ever-expanding universes. Well, some gamers with incredible stick-to-it-iveness found out that that's not actually possible due to coding (or lack thereof) that made each player invisible to each other. Despite wandering the same planet for hours and potentially standing right next to each other, no player-to-player interaction was possible. Some of the other broken light-promises (I call them that because I don't ever remember Sean Miller or any other Hello Games exec claiming some of these during pre-release interviews, but the gaming community recalls otherwise) included the possibility for building structures ala Minecraft or Fallout. Those light-promises were not met upon release. There are ways of tracking how many people are actively playing a game at any one moment, and they are used to determine a games popularity in real time. These stats don't usually surface for the general public because they generally follow the same arc, but in the case of NMS, by the time Houston realized it had a problem, the numbers proved it. 88% of NMS players worldwide put the controllers down and walked away like they just watched Apollo 13 in person. With such a failure most companies would do as the consumer did, or they would tweak the game in some downloadable content for another $30. Instead, to their credit, Hello Games listened to the gaming community and went back to work to create a series of free, literally game-changing, updates. Foundation was the first major update, and laid the… groundwork... for building planetary bases, as well as adding different game modes. Path Finder followed with three different types of vehicles (dune-buggy, hovercraft, and behemoth) to be used for planetary exploration and some extra storage. Included is another game mode titled PERMADEATH (without the caps lock ofcourse) - which plays exactly how it sounds - go until you die, then, well nobody has come back from that to tell us what happens after (perma)death… Atlas Rises arrived shortly after, reworking the main storyline and introducing new side missions, portals for traveling quicker between galaxies, new system economics and trade improvements, and joint exploration which directly leads to the next update. Next… (yep) is the latest massive update and finally made true on an original promise - multiplayer. Attached but not to be neglected is the ability to command freighter armadas and a graphics overhaul that everything look even better. By now I have spent about equal time playing the original version and the updated version with all of the new goodies (about 100 hours altogether). I tried my best to stick with NMS during the lean times; the beautiful landscapes of each planet and simple tasks created a peaceful escape from stressful everyday life. I would be dishonest, however, if I said I loved it just the way it was and didn't think about what more it could be.The updates that Hello Games made feel necessary and delivered so much more dimension and content than previously existed. I have never experienced a game like NMS, which blends perfectly the uniqueness of Minecraft with the beauty and wonder of a Sci-Fi movie poster. I'm excited to share all of this with my fellow gamers, and with Next, finally be able to meet up on Hoth (the ice planet I've colonized and named originally). With more adventures on the horizon, today NMS seems destined to be a title that will never be deemed an all-timer due to its rough start, but will instead be called something more special by its fanbase - stardust - for that unique feeling and quality No Man's Sky possesses. I told you it's grasshopper-like! This is Hoth (original) my colonized planet. This freakin planet was made entirely of hexagonal plates, reminding me of the "cob-planet from Rick and Morty.

Imo: Why I chose my son-in-law as successor – Okorocha September 3, 2018 1 Comment Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, has revealed why he is throwing his weight behind his Chief of Staff, Uche Nwosu to succeed him as governor of the state in 2019. The governor, who made this known through a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo, asserted that in a bid to avoid being missed by people of the state on some of his landmark achievements, especially his free and qualitative education programme, he has chosen Nwosu to consolidate on the projects. Governor Okorocha maintained that the free education programme in the state, which some of his opponents had tried to discredit when it was introduced, has yielded obvious remarkable results. He maintained that aside the school enrolment in the state snowballing from 381,000 in 2011 to more than One million in 2017, the state has continued to lead in JAMB applications for the seventh time . Buttressing his choice of Nwosu, Okorocha disclosed that the state has also continued to do well in West African Examination Council (WAEC) exams, emphasising on the 2018 Senior School Certificate Exam (SSCE), which the state came fifth out of the thirty-six states in the country . He also noted that his administration has more than 1,000 verifiable projects to its credit, while challenging his critics to disprove him. "We have also been claiming and indeed, truthfully, that what Governor Okorocha's administration has achieved in less than eight years, have gone beyond all that those who had governed the state before him had achieved, when you put them together. Nobody has also challenged us or tried to fault our claims. "We have equally gone the extra-mile to say that anybody who feels that he has a contrary claim to ours should indicate. "And the best way to deal with such claim and counter-claim is for those concerned to itemise their claims, publish them for public consumption, while we also publish ours, for comparative analysis. Meanwhile, a gubernatorial aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Frank Nneji has dismissed rumours in the state that he is being sponsored by Governor Okorocha as not only an insult to him, but the governor does not have the moral capacity to do so. This was just as he pointed out that Imo is today at the same stage that Anambra was in 2003 where everything had grounded to a halt. The founder of ABC Transport, who stated this at the weekend during an interactive session with newsmen in the state, said "governor Okorocha does not have the moral capacity to sponsor my gubernatorial aspiration."

GBNF xXx EVENTS - Bros Only POW/MIA FLAG I am the flag of thousands that never came home! I am the empty face of the comrade in arms that you have left behind. My colors are Black and White; there is no gray area with me. I am either behind a barbwire fence, with a watchtower over me, or lying in a shallow grave in a foreign land. There was a time when I was flown throughout this country, but now you hardly ever see me. I fly at Veterans Halls, Memorials, and the houses of those that still Remember me. I am quickly fading from your memory. I am the Forgotten One! I was spawned out of WAR; I should NEVER have been born! Is it because of that, most of you turn your head in shame when you see me? Or is it because you are trying to forget me? Is it that easy to forget a friend, a comrade, or a loved one? Tell me what I did that was so wrong, that I might know why you have left me here all these years after my Brothers have all gone home. Why must I labor for my captures, Day after Day? Why do I lie in a shallow grave in a foreign land, where No One comes to visit me? Why has my country FORSAKEN ME, and the people I fought for FORGOTTEN ME? What did I do to deserve this from MY COUNTRY? TELL ME WHY! I just want you to know! I AM STILL HERE! Bring me HOME to the land I was born in, and the Country I so PROUDLY Served! Dear GOD, bring me HOME! "BRING THEM HOME or SEND US BACK" By Stubby Viet Nam Vets / Legacy Vets MC The POW/MIA Flag The POW/MIA flag is an American flag designed as a symbol of citizen concern about United States military personnel taken as prisoners of war (POWs) or listed as missing in action (MIA). The POW/MIA flag was created by the National League of Families and officially recognized by the Congress in conjunction with the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, "as the symbol of our Nation's concern and commitment to resolving as fully as possible the fates of Americans still prisoner, missing and unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, thus ending the uncertainty for their families and the Nation." In 1971, while the Vietnam War was still being fought, Mary Hoff, the wife of a service member missing in action and member of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, recognized the need for a symbol of U.S. POW/MIAs, some of whom had been held in captivity for as many as seven years. The flag is black, and bears in the center, in black and white, the emblem of the League. The emblem was designed by Newt Heisley, and features a white disk bearing in black silhouette the bust of a man (Jeffery Heisley), watch tower with a guard on patrol, and a strand of barbed wire; above the disk are the white letters POW and MIA framing a white 5-pointed star; below the disk is a black and white wreath above the white motto: The flag has been altered many times; the colors have been switched from black with white – to red, white and blue – to white with black; the POW/MIA has at times been revised to MIA/POW. On March 9, 1989, a league flag that had flown over the White House on the 1988 National POW/MIA Recognition Day was installed in the U.S. Capitol rotunda as a result of legislation passed by the 100th Congress. The league's POW-MIA flag is the only flag ever displayed in the rotunda, and the only one other than the Flag of the United States to have flown over the White House. The leadership of both Houses of Congress hosted the installation ceremony in a demonstration of bipartisan congressional support. On August 10, 1990, the 101st Congress passed U.S. Public Law 101-355, recognizing the National League of Families POW/MIA Flag and designating it "as a symbol of our Nation's concern and commitment to resolving as fully as possible the fates of Americans still prisoner, missing and unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, thus ending the uncertainty for their families and the Nation." Beyond Southeast Asia, it has been a symbol for POW/MIAs from all U.S. wars. Flag Use With the passage of Section 1082 of the 1998 Defense Authorization Act during the first term of the 105th Congress, the POW/MIA Flag was specified to fly each year on: Armed Forces Day Third Saturday in May Memorial Day Last Monday in May Flag Day June 14 Independence Day July 4 National POW/MIA Recognition Day Third Friday in September Veterans Day November 11 The POW/MIA Flag will be flown on the grounds or the public lobbies of major military installations as designated by the U.S. Secretary of Defense, all Federal National Cemeteries, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the White House, the United States Post Offices and at official offices of the Secretaries of State, Defense and Veterans Affairs, and Director of the Selective Service System. Civilians are free to fly the POW/MIA Flag whenever they wish. In the U.S. armed forces, the dining halls, mess halls and chow halls display a single table and chair in a corner draped with the POW-MIA flag as a symbol for the missing, thus reserving a chair in hopes of their return. Other color patterns exist: the Orange and Black pattern was run by Outpost flags at the time of Harley Davidson's 100th anniversary, so that the bikers would help keep the issue alive and in the forefront of American politics. There are Red and White versions, which some say are to cover more recent military actions, but this is not official policy. There are Black and Red versions available as well.
The Moguldom Nation MogulWatch Here Are The Biggest Cultural Trends To Watch In Q3 2018 Written by Lauren DeLisa Coleman Alfre Woodard, Kerry Washington, and Brandy Rayana Norwood at Women's March Los Angeles, Jan. 21, 2017. Photo: Faye Sadou/MediaPunch/IPX Cultural trend analysis will become even more important to everyone in the third quarter of 2018 because we are in the midst of major value and sentiment paradigm shifts. Connecting will become even more important and to do so, understanding mindset, motivations, fears, and goals of society will be paramount. Here are my picks for key areas and insights that I will be tracking this year and breaking down via periodic updates: 1. Celebrity Celebrities are increasingly becoming involved in political and social issues. Trump's anti-immigration policy is only the latest, bringing out such notables as Laura Dern, Amy Schumer, Kerry Washington, Anne Hathaway, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and John Legend. These celebrities bring awareness to help keep families together. However, the next level of the narrative will be holding such notables accountable for increased participation rather than one-offs. This is where unique business opportunities will intersect with public service. Your play: Watch this. It's rare that celebs move solo. It's either all or none and usually a one-off attempt through their megaphones. As cause-related marketing ops heat up, compel them to deepen their participation by long-term strategies that your company can drive for the largest social good while still making the bottom line. 2. Race The recent use of the n-word from a now former Netflix exec gives further demonstration to the CEO as quasi-public figure in this tension-filled era. Netflix was quick to jump on this. It's just one of the increasingly bold racial outbursts in which more and more companies are finding themselves entangled. Your play: Photos such as the recreation of "A Great Day in Harlem" are nice, and they reinforce Netflix's commitment to creatives of color, but diversity is never equivalent to equity. Efforts should lead to more than images and hiring of creatives. Giving back to communities of color that Help drive Netflix's massive revenue should be next. Diversity should never be confused with equity. Spread the social word on this. 3. Millennial mashup Fortune magazine recently did a piece about certain debit cards being the new hot status symbol among 18-34. Acorns, SoFi and Venmo allegedly rank very high. Your play: Watch for articles like this because they may be jumping the gun a bit. Not all 80-plus million millennials follow the same trends. Make no mistake, the AMEX Black Card still reigns supreme in many sub demos. Others are all about crypto over any cards. Stay alert on the needs and moves of the variety of millennials and you'll stay ahead of the curve. 4. Tech Blockchain in advertising is going to be h-u-g-e. It's just that simple. As blockchain and crypto intersect vital parts of the backbone of our capitalist society, rest assured that this space will grow exponentially for the rest of the year. Your play: The most important space to watch is new ways to leverage brand messaging beyond simply using blockchain to carry out the standard ad buy with greater transparency. Those who do so will be the winners. Stay up on every conference you can attend in order to be with innovators in this important space. John Legend performs at the "Families Belong Together: Freedom for Immigrants" March on Saturday, June 30, 2018, in Los Angeles. (Photo by Willy Sanjuan/Invision/AP) 5. Politics As I mentioned in my keynote speech during the NAB Conference in Las Vegas in April, watch for increasing trends around women of color and politics. As Moguldom reported, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Latina running in her first political campaign, defeated political veteran Joe Crowley in the Democratic Party's congressional primary in New York City. What is important to note is that she is half the age of the Caucasian male she defeated and is indicative of a major power trend that will change the country as we know it! Your play: While Caucasian women in Hollywood have primarily co-opted part of the Feminism 2.0 narrative, watch for women of color to go for other levels of political and economic power to truly change the narrative of the growing majority in the U.S: people of color. See additional ways in which you can leverage each of these trends. Don't miss "Conquer All," the included track by new artist Kelvin D. Frazier, Ph.D. As our world changes, cultural intelligence is definitely the new oil.

Beyoncé's Ivy Park Responds to Factory Sweatshop Allegations May 16, 2016 1:31 PM PST Beyoncé's Ivy Park brand is fighting back against accusations their products are made in a Sri Lankan sweatshop under harsh working conditions. via WWD: On Monday, the brand said in a statement: "Ivy Park has a rigorous ethical trading program. We are proud of our sustained efforts in terms of factory inspections and audits, and our teams worldwide work very closely with our suppliers and their factories to ensure compliance." The brand added that it expects its suppliers to meet its code of conduct "and we support them in achieving these requirements." The statement came in response to a front-page story in The Sun on Sunday tabloid — never one to shun a sensational headline. The paper accused the brand of relying on "poverty-stricken seamstresses" at the MAS Holdings factory in Sri Lanka to make some of the Ivy Park clothes. The story said the mostly female workers earn 4.30 pounds a day, or $6.17, and could never afford to buy a pair of Ivy Park leggings, which can cost 100 pounds, or $144. But the minimum daily wage in Sri Lanka is 400 rupees, or $2.68. That means Ivy Park workers are earning more than twice the minimum wage for a day's work. We're glad that's settled.

This Week In: English Football – Cup Roundup and Premiership Preview January 10, 2013 ~ John Lally Alex Lawless scores the goal the secures a win for non-league Luton Town against Wolves Although last weekend saw only two Premiership clubs knocked out of the FA Cup, the third round stage has already produced some upsets, with a round of replays providing the potential for more. The biggest shocks were at Macclesfield and Luton, where the two non-league home teams knocked out Cardiff and Wolves respectively, the latter of whom subsequently sacked their manager, Ståle Solbakken. However, there was no fairy tale for Mansfield – who lost 2-1 to Liverpool, albeit somewhat controversially, as Luis Suarez had clearly handled the ball before scoring the visitor's second goal – nor for Hastings United of the Isthmian Premier Division, who were beaten 3-1 by Middlesbrough. The biggest top flight casualty was Newcastle, who produced a tepid display in their 2-0 defeat away to Brighton of the Championship, while the other Premiership side to have already exited – Southampton – were beaten by Chelsea, 5-1. All of the other three encounters between teams currently at the top of the English league pyramid ended in draws: Manchester United forced a replay against West Ham thanks to Robin Van Persie's stoppage time equaliser; Arsenal scored twice in two minutes to take the lead after they had been trailing in their game at Swansea, but the hosts forced the tie back to the Emirates with their own late strike; and Kieron Dyer found the net with virtually the last kick of the match to even things up for QPR against West Brom. Five Premiership clubs were forced into another fixture by lower league opposition: Blackpool earned a 1-1 draw at Fulham; Sunderland had to battle back from 2-0 down away at Bolton to take the tie back to the north-east; Crystal Palace and Stoke ended goalless; and Wigan came from behind to remain in the competition as their home match against Bournemouth finished 1-1. By contrast, Aston Villa, Tottenham, Everton, Reading, Manchester City or Norwich, had little trouble in all advanced to the fourth round – which will be contested over the final weekend of January. There was also League Cup action in midweek and the first legs of the two semi-finals both produced unexpected outcomes. League Two's Bradford, who had knocked out Arsenal on penalties in the quarter-finals, are half-way to claiming another Premiership scalp as they defeated Aston Villa 3-1 at Valley Parade; while Swansea were dominated by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, but the Welsh side came away with a 2-0 win and now have one foot in the final. This weekend sees the return of Premiership action and on Saturday, Harry Redknapp will have the opportunity to beat the club that sacked him, as Queens Park Rangers host Tottenham – a fixture that has been moved from its original date of Monday, January 14th as QPR have their cup replay against West Brom next Tuesday. That same day, the two sides just above the relegation zone – Aston Villa and Southampton – meet at Villa Park; Swansea travel to Everton; Stoke will have their unbeaten home record tested by Chelsea; Sunderland host West Ham; Fulham, who have won just two of their last thirteen league matches, entertain third-bottom Wigan; and West Brom have an away trip to Reading. The biggest fixtures of the weekend come on Sunday, as Arsenal host the champions, Manchester City, who have returned nearly a third of their ticket allocation, as many supporters were unwilling to pay the (ridiculous) sum of £62 to watch their team play at the Emirates, where they lost 1-0 last season; and old rivals Manchester United and Liverpool square off in the lunchtime kick off at Old Trafford. Brendan Rodgers will be hoping that his new team can continue their push up the Premiership, as they have won five of their last seven in the league, while the Red Devils will be looking to at least maintain their seven point advantage over City at the top of the table. Last time, 8-12; Season, 90-107 QPR vs Tottenham – Home win Aston Villa vs Southampton – Draw Everton vs Swansea – Draw Fulham vs Wigan – Home win Norwich vs Newcastle – Home win Reading vs West Brom – Away win Stoke vs Chelsea – Draw Sunderland vs West Ham – Home win Manchester United vs Liverpool – Home win Arsenal vs Manchester City – Draw Posted in English Football, Sports < Previous This Week in: The NFL – Wildcard Weekend Next > This Week in: The NFL – Divisional Round One thought on "This Week In: English Football – Cup Roundup and Premiership Preview" Pingback: This Week in: English Football – Arsenal vs Chelsea and Spurs vs Man United « Political Footballs

First team hold photo shoot Team photo shoot done for the season So here it is, your 2016/17 Fleetwood Town Squad. Thursday was a busy day at the club's Poolfoot Farm training ground as the first team was assembled for the official team photograph. A number of new signings also had headshots taken for the big screen at Highbury, and the club also launched the brand new Poolfoot 5's initiative, with the help of five of the first team players. A film crew were also in attendance to capture some behind the scenes footage which will be available very soon. Keep an eye out across the Official Fleetwood Town social media channels. Players enjoyed meals in Crossbar And Grill where more shots were taken for some brand new advertisements and youngsters from local schools were also treated to visits from some of the squad before their matches on the 3G pitches.

CHRIS HEDGES - CALLING ALL REBELS: THE MORAL IMPERATIVE TO REVOLT Speech by noted author and activist Chris Hedges to our neighboring Green Party of Orange County on September 20, 2015. America's Big Election Night Photo and Article by Blair Bobier Although a number of important—and under-reported—elections just took place in the U.S., the election that might ultimately matter most to Americans happened last month in Canada. There, the Liberal Party executed an '08 Obama-like ousting of the governing Conservative Party. Three aspects of the Canadian election are particularly notable and inspiring—if not downright revolutionary. One is the Liberal Party's promise to change Canada's winner-take-all elections; two is the re-election to Parliament of Green Party leader Elizabeth May; and three, is the inclusive Cabinet appointed by the new Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. German Greens support protection for Snowden The European Parliament narrowly adopted a nonbinding but nonetheless forceful resolution on 29 October 2015 urging the 28 nations of the European Union to recognize Edward J. Snowden as a "whistle-blower and international human rights defender" and shield him from prosecution. "It's the first time a Parliament votes to ask for this to be done — and it's the European Parliament," said Mr. Albrecht, a German lawmaker with the Greens political bloc.

The Spring weather has us back on the Playground Tour again! After visiting 23 playgrounds last fall (you can check out the full list here) we took the winter off. However there are still a few playgrounds that we didn't make it to in the fall, so this week we started taking advantage of the warm days to go check some out. If you recently started reading the blog, the Playground Tour was an idea I had last Fall, when I started the blog, for us to visit as many local area playgrounds as possible. The idea really started as a way for us to spend time outside and keep everyone entertained. What I quickly realized was that what started as a few simple trips to the playground quickly became so much more. We not only got to spend our afternoons playing outside but we also met lots of new people, learned about new places, discovered neighborhoods and areas in our own city that we probably wouldn't have visited before and become super knowledgeable about playground equipment. So all that said last week I was looking online and came across this article on Yahoo "The 5 Coolest Playgrounds in the U.S." To my surprise the first playground on their list is a little less then an hour away from our house. So this week, while the Bee is on her pre-school spring break, we took a little field trip to check it out. The Clemyjontri Playground is located in Virginia just off of 495 (right past Great Falls) so from Baltimore it took us about an hour to get there with traffic, less to come home. However we spent almost 2 hours playing at this playground so it made the drive well worth it. All three of us gasped when we pulled up, this playground is huge! The whole play area is centered around a carousel that was actually not running the day we went, but with so much other stuff to do we didn't miss it. There are public bathrooms and vending machines at the entrance as well as a few picnic tables. The playground was sort of divided up into a few sections but each area easily blended into the next. This is a great playground for little kids, especially the 5 and under group. The ground is covered in a nice soft rubber covering, the space is very wide and open so it is easy to keep and eye on everyone and there are lots of different cars, climbers, swings, mazes, instruments, airplanes and games to keep everyone busy. A few things to note, the playground was pretty quiet on the day we went, but from what I have read it can get pretty crowded. Parking can be a limited but the do have an overflow lot 1/4 mile away. There also isn't a lot of shade over the play area. We went on a slightly overcast day, so this wasn't a problem but I could see where this playground could be brutal in August. Although they have done a nice job providing pavilions and other covered structure if you needed to get out of the sun. Overall this playground was so much fun and with so much cool stuff to do it is definitely worth a little trip!

It can seem like a daunting task, turning a space that used to belong to someone else into a home for you and your family. Here're a list of our top four things to consider when creating your home. Some people opt to have a more formal room with the best furniture and a light colour that is not always compatible with family life. These rooms are for special occasions or when guests visit and are rarely a place you go to relax; they are a tidy reception space often designed to impress on some scale. The same home will often have a more comfortable space where the family can relax. The sofas here will be comfy to encourage snuggling up and the colours a little darker and forgiving on stains and mess. The difference in the feel of these two spaces has been achieved purely through decoration, and it reflects how the family like to live and receive guests. In short, it makes use of the space in their house in a way that suits their character, an essential element of a home. In contrast, some people prefer to use every available space and are happy to receive guest in rooms they also slob out in. It really does depend on your preference and personality. This one may seem obvious, but it goes beyond a roaring fire in the winter, particularly if you have children to consider. Rooms that are too hot or too cold effect the way we sleep, the activities we do and how much time we spend in them. Making sure your family are comfortable is one of the easiest ways to ensure you home is a retreat during hot summer days and cold winter nights. Visit http://www.lairdandson.com to find out what heating or cooling system is best suited to your home and your family. It is the first thing we think about when we buy a house or fancy a change. Decorating is our way of putting a personal stamp on four bare walls and transforming a plain space into a home we can relax in. How you use the space and the kind of look you are going for will all dictate how your rooms are styled. Some people love the cluttered, family look and others find it difficult to switch off if everything's a mess. Making a room feel cosy and welcoming whatever your personality is key to transforming your house into a home. Books, whether they are stacked on tables or arranged neatly in the bookcase, instantly transform a space and are a great choice for making a room feel homey. Make use of different textures by layering relaxing spaces, like your bedroom or living room, with soft throws, plush rugs and comfy cushions. In the end, we create these welcoming spaces for the people in our lives. Whether we use our homes to entertain friends, catch up with family or play with our children, it is the people we fill them with that make them the spaces we want to be in most.

Summit Daily News names Ian Donovan as its new advertising director Local | November 9, 2017 Ian Donovan Hugh Carey / hcarey@summitdaily.com | The Summit Daily News has restructured its advertising department and is pleased to announce Ian Donovan has been promoted to advertising director. Donovan moved up Nov. 1 after starting with the Summit Daily as an account manager and most recently serving as its digital sales manager. Leading a six-person staff as advertising director, he will be tasked with overseeing all advertising operations at the Summit Daily, including print, digital and niche publications. "I'm ecstatic to be helping businesses in the Summit County community grow, both financially and as community partners," Donovan said of the promotion. He lives in Summit County with his wife and loves the "endless possibility of fishing holes and ski lines" that can be found here. Donovan has a bachelor's degree in resort and hospitality management from Green Mountain College in Killington, Vermont, and has worked for Swift Communications since September 2014. Swift is the parent company of the Summit Daily News, in addition to more than two dozen other community newspapers and niche publications across the Western United States. Donovan previously sold marketing solutions through the Colorado Activities Center before coming to the Summit Daily News. At the same time Donovan is being promoted, advertising sales manager Emma Simmins has been named the general manager of the Sky-Hi News, a sister publication of the Summit Daily that covers Grand County. In her new role, Simmins will oversee all operations in the Granby office, including editorial, circulation and advertising. She lives in Kremmling and is excited to be working closer to home.

Simmins has been in newspaper advertising sales since October 2009, and she has a bachelor's degree in business management from the University of Northern Colorado. She started with Swift in May 2015 and formerly served as the classified ad manager for the Steamboat Pilot & Today, another publication in the Swift family, before coming to the Summit Daily. "Ian and Emma are proven leaders. Both promotions are well-deserved, and the Summit Daily and Sky-Hi News teams are better for their leadership," said Meg Boyer, publisher of both newspapers. —Summit Daily staff report Summit School District wins $155K grant from El Pomar Foundation Mountain Dreamers petitions Summit School District for protections against searches by ICE Drivers at Christy Sports in FRISCO The Christy Sports Summit County Warehouse NOW HIRING  Drivers Competitive Wage Free Ski Pass…
You are here: Home / Industry Insider / Lavish Locations Lavish Locations The early beginnings and luxury dispensaries of entrepreneur Susan Hwang by R. Scott Rappold | July 4, 2019 You've heard the phrase "living hand to mouth." That's how Susan Hwang was forced to run her first medical cannabis dispensary—taking the day's sales revenue to Phoenix, Arizona to buy more cannabis to sell the next day, spending eight hours a day driving around. Even when the dispensary was making $1 million a month, she said and home was a one-bedroom apartment, not that it mattered. Who had time to be home sleeping? Such were the hazards of diving into the nascent cannabis business without a big chunk of cash or the backing of wealthy investors. "I had to do what I had to do. I didn't want to sell ownership to a big investment group," she said. "I didn't want to be one of 20 board members. I had a vision, and I wanted to execute it." Execute it she has. The 32-year-old now owns a chain of medical cannabis dispensaries and associated cultivation operations, as well as cannabis consulting firm SH Management Services—not bad for someone who immigrated to the U.S. at the age of 12 with nothing but a suitcase shared with her father and sister. And she's just getting started. Hwang just might be changing how people shop for cannabis. Hwang didn't speak a word of English in the late 1990s when her family fled South Korea's economic crisis that cost them everything. The family moved to Los Angeles, California, then Tennessee, scraping by the best they could, sometimes living with friends, working multiple jobs. She spent nights after school working in the family's janitorial business. After graduating high school she went to college at Arizona State University, graduating in 2009 with a biochemistry degree. Her parents hoped she'd be a surgeon someday. "They didn't want me to an entrepreneur, because of what they'd been through. They wanted me to take the safe route," she recalled. She was studying for a master's degree when Arizona began implementing voter-approved medical cannabis. Despite her parents' worries, and despite the fact she'd never even tried cannabis, she had an "innate entrepreneurial spirit" that couldn't resist the possibilities of this new industry. Arizona implemented a system with stricter limits on the number of dispensaries than states like California or Colorado, so when Hwang was approved for one of the precious few licenses, it was off to the races. "I'm introducing some different concepts that the market has not seen. The words 'smoke shop' and 'luxury' don't always go together." While many dispensaries were focusing on the population centers of Phoenix and Tucson, Hwang took a different approach. She opened a dispensary in Eloy, population 19,000, about halfway between those two cities. She opened a dispensary in remote Yuma, which is still that city's only one. Both are named Jamestown. She chose off-the-beaten-path locations because she didn't want to compete with other dispensaries selling $5 grams. That's the same reason she hasn't considered expanding into crowded marketplaces such as Colorado or Washington. "If it's too easy to get licenses, I don't go for it," she said. Since most of her initial money went to licensing and dispensary construction, the pace of growth was necessarily slow. "Because I got into the industry with no money, I couldn't do what people with money were doing," Hwang said. "I needed to leverage existing business to continue to build." Still, she was eventually able to move from her one-bedroom apartment to a house, and she was able to actually spend some time there. She obtained a third dispensary in California. Instead of driving around buying product, her chain was growing it. She even tried cannabis, found she liked it and came out of the "cannabis closet" publicly. Through it all, she resisted the urge to pull in major investors or become publicly traded, for fear of losing control. "I'm not in it [to] get big, get a high valuation, sell out and retire," she says. Rather, she wants to use her science background to learn more about the plant and educate others. That's a mission of her consulting firm, and it's something she hopes to further with a novel approach to selling cannabis. Luxury Boutiques Why, Hwang asks, does society glorify alcohol with expensive wine, fancy craft beer and upscale bars, yet cannabis is often sold out of boring, nondescript buildings, often in the seedier parts of town? So, she wants to bring some luxury to cannabis with high-end cannabis boutiques with top-dollar smoking and vaping implements—think the Louis Vuitton or Neiman Marcus of cannabis. "I'm introducing some different concepts that the market has not seen. The words 'smoke shop' and 'luxury' don't always go together," Hwang admitted. It's a way to challenge the stereotypes people have about cannabis consumers. She is also eyeing places most sensible cannabis investors aren't even looking at. She says she is prepared to enter the medical cannabis markets of Georgia, Texas, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and even her native South Korea, which legalized medical cannabis nationwide in 2018. Hwang takes a lot of pride in accomplishing so much out of humble beginnings. "I'm very honored and grateful and thankful," she said. "All the adversities and hardships and challenges I've been through as a child and am still going through today are what helped me and molded me and shaped me." "When people ask me what it feels like to be successful, I don't know how to answer," she said. "My definition of being successful is inspiring others and elevating other peoples' lives and lifestyles. There are so many people I want to inspire. I want to continue to change their lives. I want them living like me but better than me."

JEREMY CHILDS/THE STAR The main attractions were the six separate hunts which had more than 15,000 Easter eggs among them. Volunteers dispersed the eggs within a sectioned off area of the park, split into two parts — for children ages 5 and younger and those ages 6 and up. When given the green light, kids swarmed the field and tried to fill their baskets with as many eggs as possible. It was highly competitive, with some children walking away with several eggs in their basket and others with none. "I wanted to leave some so the little kids could get them," said Emily Ake, who gathered two eggs during a hunt for ages 6 and up. The festival also had a crafting booth for children, offering them the chance to decorate the plastic pots of drought-resistant succulents. It also featured a petting zoo, two bounce houses, an Easter Bunny photo opportunity and booths with carnival games. A DJ played dance music next to a stage that featured gymnastics demonstrations from Cartwheel A Go Go and a tap dance performance from participants in the Camarillo Community Center's dance classes. Journey: The Church, which congregates nearby at the Camarillo Community Center, sponsored the egg hunt for the sixth time this year. The church helped facilitate the event, provided eggs with prizes inside them and distributed bottles of water. Jeremy Kays, a pastor, said he hoped the event would help bring people together in celebration of the occasion. "It's about loving the community," he said.

National September 11 Memorial & Museum, New York (must see) The National September 11 Memorial & Museum (known separately as the 9/11 Memorial and 9/11 Memorial Museum) are the principal memorial and museum, respectively, commemorating the September 11, 2001, attacks, which killed 2,977 people, and the World Trade Center bombing of 1993, which killed six. The memorial is located at the World Trade Center site, the former location of the Twin Towers, which were destroyed during the September 11 attacks. It is operated by a non-profit corporation whose mission is to raise funds for, program, own, and operate the memorial and museum at the World Trade Center site. On September 11, 2011, a dedication ceremony commemorating the tenth anniversary of the attacks was held at the memorial. Three months after its opening, the memorial had been visited by over a million people. In 2012 Tuesday's Children, a non-profit family-service organization dedicated to the individuals directly impacted by 9/11 and those who have lost loved ones to terrorism worldwide, joined with the 9/11 Memorial to offer private tours to family members of 9/11 victims and first responders. There has been a lot of thought gone into making this tribute to all those who lost their lives. You can go down 70 feet underground to the original bedrock and pillars the buildings were built on, or walk the grounds outside and look at the fountains. Many personal belongings of the victims and remnants of structural portions of the buildings and city emergency vehicles are present to view, also.

The Lord of Castle Black (Viscount of Adrilankha, Book 2) Synopsis of The Lord of Castle Black (Viscount of Adrilankha, Book 2) Continuing the swashbuckling epic begun in The Paths of the Dead Journeys! Intrigues! Sword fights! Young persons having adventures! Beloved older characters having adventures, too! Quests! Battles! Romance! Snappy dialogue! Extravagant food! And the missing heir to the Imperial Throne!In the swashbuckling, extravagant manner of The Phoenix Guards, Five Hundred Years After, and The Paths of the Dead, this is an old-fashioned adventure--moving at a twenty-first-century pace. The Interregnum is over. To everyone's astonishment, Zerika, a very young Phoenix, has coolly emerged from the Paths of the Dead, carrying with her the Orb, which everyone had thought was lost in Adron's Disaster. The Orb is the heart of the Dragaeran Empire, the source of all its magic--and the infallible sign that Zerika is the new Empress. But not everyone is happy to hear the news. It's been 250 years since Adron's Disaster, and power vacuums never stay that way for long. K...na, a Dragonlord, has been expanding his holdings. He now controls almost half the area that was once the Empire -- in effect, the Empire re-created, with himself on the throne. Among those opposing him is a young Dragonlord named Morrolan - the same Morrolan familiar to every reader of the Vlad Taltos adventures. Until recently, Morrolan was an orphan raised among Easterners, unaware of his lineage, but it has belatedly come to his attention that he's a high-ranking Dragonlord, and now he means to act like one. And from Sethra Lavode he has received a gift of immense significance and power: Blackwand, a magical artifact in the form of a sword. He'll find plenty to do with it. Reviews of The Lord of Castle Black (Viscount of Adrilankha, Book 2) In short, this reviewer believes there is no coin better spent than in the purchase of this new work by Paarfi (and of any of his Books). Should you seek his work, be sure to look also under the name of Brust, his translator. -- Edward Carmien, SFRevu I have to admit that I didn't really enjoy Brust's latest offering that much. Oh, sure, it's better than 95% of the Books on my shelves, and I devoured it in a day, but still... -- Dave Kennedy, DKennedy.org Employing his "Dumas homage" presentation, the reader is both entertained by the story itself and by the humorous narrative of Paarfi the historian. -- R.F. Briggs, Yet Another Book Review Site
How does Veena Sud create the dreamy, hypnotic tone of AMC's "The Killing"? By writing the show when she should be dreaming. The show runner of the AMC series, which debuts Sunday, tricks herself into forgetting her deadlines by nestling into bed in pajamas, with her nice, warm dog and a hot cup of coffee — and then writing for hours. The series follows a female Seattle detective, Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) as she tries to solve the murder of a young girl, Rosie Larsen. The supporting characters include a boundary-crossing new investigator; Rosie's parents, Mitch and Stan; and a mayoral candidate prone to secrecy. And then there's that other show about a young girl's murder in the misty, mysterious Northwest: For our second edition of The Writer's Room, TheWrap's new feature on writers and how they write, Sud tells us how she and her writing team dreamed up "The Killing" — but not how they'll handle the Laura Palmer Dilemma that bedeviled "Twin Peaks." You wrote the pilot, the next episode, the tenth episode, and the finale, in addition to supervising all of the writing as the show runner. Isn't that a lot? I think that's par for the course. I did that on "Cold Case." Usually I would definitely do the first one and then jump in in the middle of the season and then do the last one. That was 24 episodes though, and this is thirteen. So yeah, I'm tired. It's a group process… we spend a lot of time together in the room, myself and my writers. We spent a good solid month at the beginning of the series… and just kind of built these characters from the ground up. There's this giant board with all our secrets and all our characters. It was just saying, who is Mitch? What are her dreams? Who is Stan? Let's talk about the marriage. … We wanted to make sure that there were deep, deep, deep character stories we were telling. When you sit down to write your episodes, when do you write? The normal workday is just jam-packed usually… the best times are really late at night, on the weekends and really early in the morning. When the phone's just ringing and there's silence. … For one hour, two hours, three hours I can just immerse myself in the story. Does losing sleep help you write in a way? I've been told that Kurt Vonnegut used to set his alarm so he could write when he would have entered R.E.M. I think it must, right? Because so much of your defenses are down if you're tired. You're forced to come to your screen or your writing pad tired, exhausted, unable to distract yourself. It certainly helps me. I started to do things like write in bed, write in places that didn't feel official. Here's a place where I can just sit and relax and be myself and let the characters speak. Does that work when you're on deadline? You know how Dalton Trumbo wrote in the bathtub? I remember being like, that's so bizarre, I wonder why he did it. And I think it's because you trick your mind a little bit. … There's so much time pressure in a TV script and on a television show to deliver. It helps me to almost psychologically trick myself like, gosh, this is such a wonderful, leisurely place, I can be in my bed and be in my pajamas with my dog. I'm working, and part of myself knows that I have a deadline, but I don't start cramping up and start worrying and fretting about that deadline. And you never just doze off? Coffee has been a huge key to the last year. The big question "Twin Peaks" had to address was what to do after the murder was solved. What do you do about the Laura Palmer Dilemma? We'll see when we get there. [Laughs.] We'll totally see when we get there. Do you know who the killer is? And did you have to know when you started? Our killer's different from the Danish series, and no. I had ideas in my head, but that was one of the great things that happened. We locked ourselves in the room and said, how could this happen? And because there weren't any kind of preconceived notions that it has to be this person, coming to that moment where the decision was made was just great. The first two episodes of "The Killing" air at 9 p.m. Sunday on AMC.
Hi there! I am new to these forums. I hope everyone is having a great day so far. I wanted to share a few ideas as what I feel could improve an already amazing game. Feel free to share your ideas here too! 1. I would love to see an expansion to the Ranch. I feel that the area behind Beatrix's house could have land placed there and be used to provide space to the Ranch. 2. I would like to see more upgrades for the Ranch and Lab. There is quite a large amount of the laboratory roof that is missing. I think it would be good to have upgrades that improve the overall appearance of the lab. The "home" cell of the ranch is meant to be that way. It also makes it easier for new players to get rid of the Tarr, or for players in general to dispose items. The second idea however I would like to see. Yo! I am the self-proclaimed king of the forums! Al, hail me! But I'm Self-Proclaimed! Have I been Self-Dethroned?

to Golden gate. Just before Golden Gate take left and walk for 50 meters to Majstora Jurja 4. Enter through the Golden gate, this is the side away from the water. It has the huge statue "Grgur Ninski" out front for reference. Once you enter through the "gate" make the first right hand turn onto a "street" Majstora Jurja. The street will just twist & turn but keep following it going straight. Look for Portas Pizza as a reference point on the left side under a beautiful gazebo. Keep going straight with the twists in the road. Look for Teak café on the left- it's where the locals go to drink coffee. This is where one of the apartments is.

Q: Python Tuple Class Memory Why does the use of tuple instead of list in objects below increase memory usage? from pympler.asizeof import asizeof class myClass(object): __slots__ = ('l') def __init__(self, m): self.l = m m = range(10) ob = [myClass(m) for i in xrange(100000)] print asizeof(ob) for o in ob: o.l = tuple(o.l) print asizeof(ob) The first has size 64697936 The second has size 200697784 A: In your original code, every myClass instance points to the same list. >>> ob[0].l.append('foo') >>> ob[1].l ['foo'] In other words: you compared the memory usage of one list to that of 100,000 tuples. Compare it to 100,000 lists instead: for o in ob: o.l = list(o.l) with these results: 6424936 27224856 The original: 6424936 20024784
GPUs are not just for images any more… |In Machine Learning |By Filament As a machine learning professional specialising in computational linguistics (helping machines to extract meaning from human text), I have confused people on multiple occasions by suggesting that their document processing problem could be solved by neural networks trained using a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). You'd be well within your rights to be confused. To the uninitiated what I just said was "Let's solve this problem involving reading lots of text by building a system that runs on specialised computer chips designed specifically to render images at high speed". "In the age of the neural network, Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is one of the biggest misnomers of our time." Well it turns out that GPUs are good for more than playing Doom in high definition or rendering the latest Pixar movie. GPUs are great for doing maths. As it happens, they're great for the kind of maths needed for training neural networks and other kinds of machine learning models. So what I'm trying to say here is that in the age of the neural network, Graphics Processing Unit is one of the biggest misnomers of our time. Really they should be called "Tensor-based linear algebra acceleration unit" or something like that (this is probably why I'm a data scientist and not a marketer). Where did GPUs come from? One of the earliest known uses of the term GPU is from a 1986 book called "Advances in Computer Graphics". Originally, GPUs were designed to speed up the process of rendering computer games to the user's display. Traditional processor chips used for running your computer's operating system and applications process one instruction at a time in sequence. Digital images are made up of thousands or millions of pixels in a grid format. Traditional CPUs have to render images by running calculations on each pixel, one at a time: row by row, column by column. GPUs accelerate this process by building an image in parallel. The below video explains the key difference here quite well: So I know what you're thinking… "If GPUs are so magical and can do all this cool stuff in parallel, why don't we just use them all the time instead of CPUS?" — am I right? Well here's the thing… GPUs are specialised for really fast maths and CPUs are generalised for many tasks. That means that GPUS are actually pretty rubbish at a lot of things CPUs are good at — they've traded flexibility for speed. Let me try and explain with a metaphor. The Patisserie Chef and the Cake Factory Let's away from the computer for a second and take a few moments to think about a subject very close to my heart… food. A patisserie chef is highly efficient at making yummy cakes and pastries to delight their customers. They can only really pay attention to one cake at a time but they can switch between tasks. For example, when their meringue is in the oven they can focus on icing a cake they left to cool earlier. Trained chefs are typically very flexible and talented and they can make many different recipes — switching between tasks when they get time. At some point in history, Mr Kipling and those guys who make twinkies got so many orders that human bakers would never be able to keep up with demand. They had to add cake machines. A factory contains machines that spit out thousands of cakes in parallel. The key difference is that these machines are not flexible in the way that a human chef would be. What if we're churning out a batch of 10,000 french fancies when we get a call to stop production and make country slices instead? Imagine how long it would take to go around and stop all the machines, put the new ingredients in and then start the process again! A human chef could just throw out the contents of their oven and get started on the new order right away! The factory probably can't even handle doing lots of different jobs. I bet they have different machines for the different products or at the very least have to significantly alter the production line. In contrast, the patisserie chef can just change what they do with their hands! By the way, this post is not in any way sponsored by Hostess or Mr Kipling. I just like cake. Did you spot the metaphor here? The slower but more flexible chef is a CPU — plodding along one order at a time, switching when he gets some availability. The cake factory is a GPU — designed to churn out thousands of similar things as quickly as possible at the cost of flexibility. This is why GPUs aren't a one size fits all solution for all of our computing needs. Like I said earlier, GPUs are great at maths. They can be employed to draw really pretty pictures but they can also be used for all sorts of real world, mathematical operations where you need to run the same calculations on large batches of data. Training a neural network uses a lot of these streamlined mathematical operations regardless of whether they are trained to detect cats, play Go or detect nouns, verbs and adjectives in text. Using a trained neural network to make predictions is less computationally expensive but you might still benefit from running it on a GPU if you are trying to make a lot of predictions very quickly! © 2022 Filament Consultancy Group.

We go to the Zuni Pueblo to record the sounds of a relay run across New Mexico from Taos Pueblo to the Hopi Reservation commemorating the Pueblo Uprising against the Spanish in 1680, and walk with a Zuni elder to a Runners Meditation Rock on a mountain above the village where long-distance runners meditated in preparation for competition. As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down, America's soldiers are returning home by the tens of thousands. Some of them are coming home with physical wounds and will face enormous challenges in their readjustment. Many more are coming home with wounds of the heart and mind, and are struggling with depression, substance abuse and other symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). And while doctors and researchers work to develop cutting-edge treatments for this affliction, the VA Center in Salt Lake City is offering a healing ceremony that reaches back to America's first warriors: Native Americans. Each week, a group of vets attend a sweat lodge ceremony, held in a garden on the VA campus. The sweats are conducted by Native American spiritual leader Arnold Thomas in a dome-shaped structure called a lodge. Sweats are common in Indian country, and ceremonies specifically designed to help returning warriors heal spiritually have taken place for centuries. Over the past several years, the sweats at the Salt Lake City VA Center have drawn increasing numbers of non-Native veterans as well, who've made them an integral part of their treatment for PTSD. Visit the Salt Lake City VA: www.saltlakecity.va.gov. Media producer Taki Telonidis found out about these sweats while conducting research for a larger project about Native Americans in the military called Healing the Warrior's Heart. Our story reveals how a life-changing personal experience put Supaman, a Native American Hip Hop artist, on a different course, and infused his music with a new, positive message. His music has followed the dramatic trajectory of his life on the Crow Reservation in southeastern Montana, from the early years celebrating the "gangsta" life he and his friends were leading, an existence marked by poverty, crime and substance abuse, to new messages of compassion, Christian love, and humor. Throughout, his songs still have signature rugged beats and heavy-hitting metaphors. Supaman is part of a growing community of rappers on reservations in the West who are making music based on Native realities. Although Hip Hop was born in the inner city and originally reflected the experience of African American youth in the ghetto, it has resonated with Native Americans who face similar challenges out on remote reservations. Our story traces the fall and rise of an animal that has been central to Navajo life for as long as anyone can remember, the Churro sheep. The Churro is woven into the tribe's creation story, which mentions that Talking God created the Churro by using clouds for the body, willows for the legs, and rainbows for the hooves and horns. The Churro was also key to the economic survival of the Navajo on the harsh desert of the Southwest, providing them with food and clothing. Yet in modern times, the Churro was hunted to near extinction by the US government. Beginning in the late 1860's with the forced relocation of the Navajo, and as recently as the 1940s these animals were hunted down by agents and shot on sight. Then in the 1970s a Utah professor stumbled upon remnants of the once-great Churro herds and began a campaign to bring them back. He partnered with Navajo herders and elders, and together they began to systematically breed and reintroduce these animals to the reservation. The return of the Churro has contributed to a revival of Navajo weaving, and the tasty meat has meant increased income for herders. Sheep rancher and Navajo spiritual leader Roy Kady hosts the annual celebration of Sheep is Life Celebration. This festival is organized by Navajo sheep herders and weavers to honor the central role of sheep and fiber arts in the spirituality, philosophy, and daily life of cultures throughout the world. Hal Cannon accompanies a group of Lakota Indians on an odyssey to reclaim the remains of their ancestor, a Lakota chief who was killed at the massacre of Wounded Knee in 1890, and tells the story of past and present as those remains are brought home. This and other stories are included in our Deep West Recording, Stories From Native America, now out of print.

Mets Morning News Mets Morning News: It's a very sad Harvey Day Your Saturday morning dose of New York Mets and Major League Baseball news, notes, and links. By Steve Schreiber@sschreiber13 Oct 5, 2013, 11:58am EDT Share All sharing options for: Mets Morning News: It's a very sad Harvey Day Meet the Mets The biggest news in Metsland yesterday was that Matt Harvey will in fact undergo Tommy John surgery on his right elbow later this month. Both Sandy Alderson and David Wright gave their takes on the news and both said that Harvey made the right decision. It's sad news for the 2014 Mets but they still have a season to play, so what should they do? Mets fans won't accept a lost 2014 even without Harvey, says Mike Vaccaro. Luckily, Will Carroll says that it's likely that Harvey will return from the surgery as good as ever. Even with Harvey out, the Mets still have a glut of young pitchers and that bodes well for their future. Mike Kerwick spoke to Jason Parks about the futures of Noah Syndergaard, Rafael Montero, and Steven Matz. Sandy Alderson says that the Mets need to add more quality arms in the bullpen. Mike Puma reports that Carlos Beltran said he wouldn't rule out returning to the Mets for 2014. Puma also says that the Mets would consider Beltran, though his declining range in the outfield may be an issue. Toby Hyde continues to recap the Mets' Sterling Award Winners, looking at St. Lucie winner Dustin Lawley. The Binghamton Mets long rumored move to Ottawa seems to be officially dead, as the city is looking to add an independent league team instead. Johan Santana has begun throwing again, which is great news for him. Of course, it remains to be seen if he ever dons a Mets uniform again. Yesterday At AA Eric created BringBackBeltran.com, a website devoted to bringing back Carlos Beltran. Be sure to give Carlos a high-five, too! Should the Mets tender or non-tender Omar Quintanilla this offseason? Jeffrey Paternostro wrote about Brooklyn righty Miller Diaz. Around the Playoffs There were four playoff games yesterday: In the second game of their series, the Pirates beat the Cardinals 7-1 and evened things up at a game apiece. Rookie pitcher Gerrit Cole was excellent for Pittsburgh. The Red Sox stomped on the Rays 12-2 in the opener of their series. Game two of that series is tonight at 5:30, as John Lackey matches up with David Price. The Braves took game two of their series with the Dodgers by a score of 4-3, as the teams are tied at one. Finally, the Tigers beat the A's 3-2 in the opener of their set. Game two of that series takes place tonight at 9:00, when Justin Verlander takes on Sonny Gray. Around the Majors Alex Rodriguez filed two lawsuits yesterday – one against Major League Baseball for pursuing him in what was termed as a "witch hunt", and a medical malpractice lawsuit against the Yankees team doctor. The Reds canned Dusty Baker yesterday, the first move the team made after getting eliminated from the playoffs. While Tony LaRussa is said to not be interested in the job, Jim Riggleman is considered a candidate for some reason. Despite rumors that one of them would be fired, both Mike Scioscia and Jerry DiPoto are now expected to be back for the Angels in 2014. Executive director of the MLB players union Michael Weiner is said to have just 2-6 months to live due to a cancerous brain tumor. Albert Pujols has sued Jack Clark over the steroids claims he made on the radio in August. If you read an article or find a link that you think would be a great addition to a future edition of Mets Morning News, please forward it to our tips email address tips@grission.com and we'll try to add it in.
I have started watching this tv show called Revolution. The premise? All of the power all over the world goes out. It was instantaneous. Cars stopped, communication ended, planes fell from the sky. The world went from an electronic age back to a primitive way of life. Those that were smart left cities and formed little villages where they grew their own food and each person had a job to fulfill to keep the community going. Fifteen years after the blackout, a group of people have banned together to revolt against an authoritarian regime. It is such an awesome show, full of sword fights and crossbows and revenge. On another level, though, it is very thought-provoking. I mean, what would you do if something like that happened? Would you be able to live off of the land and go back to a pioneering way of life? Where would you go? Craig and I talk about that fairly regularly - not because we foresee it happening but because he is a "survival" junkie. He loves researching "bug out bags" or how to make fire with a soda can or what foods work are best to eat when stuck in the middle of nowhere in a snow storm. Aside from all of that though, we actually talk about where we would go if something like that were to happen. There is no doubt. We would go to Reform, AL. You remember that place: we visit my grandmother there once a month. My grandparents own over 100 acres of land out there and they divied up 20+ acres for each of their children. My dad's section is large enough for all of us to prosper. The soil is good for growing food and the surrounding land supports plentiful wildlife. It is minimally populated, and most that do live there are related to us in some way. It seems the perfect place. Of course we would have lots to learn like how to hunt, how to make all foods from scratch, or how to keep our home warm in the winter. But it would be ok because there is so much beauty there. And sometimes - just sometimes - you could see something like this. Yep, that would be a horse. It made it's way into the field beside my grandmother's house. Sure it belongs to someone who eventually came and got it, but the point is it was free to roam. It was free because that is the country life. There are hardly any cars that pass through those roads, everyone knows and trusts everyone else, and life in general is just simpler. Sometimes that just sounds like heaven. Or at least it sounds like the place to go when all power goes out. Hey, it could happen. I guess.
Alan Kyle's life in farming began at the Diamond, Fintona in County Tyrone. From here, in 1944, he moved with his parents to a 72 acre farm near Omagh. In due course, he took over the running of the farm from his father and with the support of his wife, Agnes. From the age of 15, in a series of diaries, Alan recorded on a daily basis the trials, tribulations, rewards and highlights of more than 50 years in farming. In this book, using extracts from the diaries, Alan shares his experiences and views on the changing world of agriculture with a wider audience. I was fortunate to work Alan and Agnes Kyle on the design and artwork of their 464 page book "A Touch of Grass." It was a pleasure to work with the couple and to have been introduced to the various events throughout their lives that have been included in this book. The book has been a great success and has seen two print runs to keep up for the demand for the publication. When I first spoke to Alan he expressed his passion for high quality milk production from high quality grass, hence the title, 'A Touch of Grass'. With this in mind I decided to use the theme of grass as a page background, and subsequently pulled handfuls of grass out of my garden which I then scanned and placed onto the pages. The results turned out great and really give the design a fresh agricultural feel. Turned out great and Alan, Agnes and their family were very pleased with the result.

ENG-355 Multi-Cultural Literature Blog Portfolio 2022 Themes of Powerlessness and Choice in Literature The works for this week are all centered around themes of powerlessness and choice. Our first work is 'The Metamorphosis', by Kafka. In 'The Metamorphosis', the main character awakens and finds himself to be transformed into a massive insect, powerless to change his fate, left with the decision of how to cope with it. The second work was "The Guest", by Camus. In this story, a school teacher is given the order to turn an Arab man over to the authorities and must choose whether or not to do so, while the prisoner is powerless to influence the decision. The third work is "Requiem" by Akhmatova, a poem about the hopelessness of war, the powerlessness of being one person amidst so much evil, and making the choice to be a witness and documentor of the tragedy. Finally, the fourth is "Faust", by Goethe, a story about a man who feels powerless choosing to make a deal with the devil. Theme: Powerlessness and Choice One of the best examples from these works that showcases the central themes is Faust. At the beginning of the story, Faust, the main character, feels completely powerless. He sees no point in living, and is about to kill himself until angels intervene and stop him. Then, through a series of events, he is offered a deal from Mephistopheles, the devil. In exchange for his soul, he is offered worldly pleasure and knowledge. He decides to make a bet with Mephistopheles, believing the Devil is incapable of following through on the deal. If Mephistopheles can show him something that eases his suffering and satisfies him, Faust will be his servant forever, trading his soul for that satisfaction. From his powerlessness, he makes a powerful and risky choice. Here is an example of an activity to teach these themes to students. Ask the students to think of an example of powerlessness in other media, such as movies and popular shows. See if they can look in those same media and find themes of choice. For example, suppose someone chose the movie "The Lion King" for their theme of powerlessness, since Simba was powerless to save his father. If they look, the theme of choice is also present in the narrative. Throughout the movie, Simba must choose whether to claim his place on the throne, or to continue to run from his past. Or, another example, the movie "Brave", in which Merida is set to be married off against her will, and chooses to try and use magic to avoid it. There are many examples in pop culture of a theme of powerlessness and choice, and inviting students to look outside of the assigned texts may raise their interest in learning to identify themes. Once everyone has thought of an example, either have each student explain either out loud in discussion time why they chose that piece of media and how the themes show up in it, or have them turn it in as a written assignment.

We all recognize the importance of well-being. It's really essential to be physically healthy. But it's like nurturing only the outer layer of fruit. If the seed is not healthy, then that nourishment goes in vain. Likewise, living with just a physically fit body without spiritual fitness won't make us lead a life of a complete well-being. When there is a lack of spirituality in the society, mental impurity begins to build up in the environment. This is known as Psychological Pollution. And this depletes the 'spiritual energy'. Meditation is a spiritual union that allows the higher consciousness of ours to bond with the collective energy of the universe. Hence, in order to reveal the secret of spiritually fit body, mind and soul and to make people feel the magic of spiritual nourishment in their life, Divya Jyoti Jagrati Sansthan (DJJS) - a non-profit, non-government and a leading spiritual organization, head and founded by His Holiness Shri Ashutosh Maharaj Ji, organized a program of Monthly Spiritual Congregation on Sunday, June 12th, 2016 at Nurmahal Ashram, Punjab. The program was commenced with holy prayer at the lotus feet of Lord. Devotional bhajans and songs sung with utmost dedication mesmerized the audience. The profound sense of devoting the life for a supreme cause filled the surrounding with divinity. Thousands of people sitting in meditation generated multitudes of positivity in the environment. The spiritual discoursers from the dais shared the necessity of spirituality by making people realize the loss by not making it a part of our life. Today when the universe is full of negative energies, it becomes our prime duty to meditate and purify it as much as we can. Don't let even a single minute of your life go waste. If you wile away this time and do not meditate, its value will be gone as your soul will miss out the most divine experiences of the Lord. On the other hand, if you meditate hard during this time, then you will become the brightest gems.

At 6:38 p.m., Oct. 23, White Mountain Search and Rescue received a call to search for two hikers lost above Argentina Trailhead in the White Mountain Wilderness of the Lincoln National Forest near Ruidoso. Three members responded, along with teams from Alamogordo, Organ Mountain Technical Rescue, Mesilla Valley, Doña Ana SAR, and the Border Patrol. The teams assembled around 10:30 p.m. at the Little Bonito trailhead near the Argentina Trail. The Incident Commander was Rick Overmier from Chaves County. Because the Argentina trailhead area is down in a valley, Overmier had the WMSAR communications van positioned high at the Crest trailhead near Monjeau Peak. Three ground teams were sent up Little Bonito Trail to search around midnight. The two subjects left word at with a girlfriend before their cellphone battery ran out that they thought they were off the Crest Trail on Barber Ridge. She reported their situation to State Police at 6:30 p.m. They had no water, food or shelter and were soaking wet. With the rain, fog and dropping temperature, hypothermia was the chief concern, and finding them quickly was paramount. Team One reached Crest Trail at Little Bonita first, but the team leader was feeling some distress from the altitude, so WMSAR's Mike Bilbo took over. Ocermier had them stay there, as at that point they had good communications with both Monjeau and to Incident base. This turned out to be a good move. Teams Two and Three proceeded up the Crest Trail to the Barber Ridge turnoff, all the time pausing to call out for the subjects. At that point, suggested by Incident Base, Team Three split up, with some staying at the junction for radio communication and several joining Team Three to search along Barber Ridge. At 4:45 a.m. Wednesday, the joint Team Two made contact with the subjects by voice and at 5:45 a.m. found them on a ridge just parallel to Barber Ridge. That information was transmitted by relay from Team Two to Team Three to Team One to the WMSAR communications van near Monjeau and finally to Incident Base. This complicated four-step relay was occasioned by the complicated terrain and poor transmission conditions. Team Two provided dry clothes, food and water to the subjects and kept them sheltered from the rain until daybreak. They then all proceeded down the Crest Trail and Little Bonito, arriving back to the trailhead around 10:30 a.m. In all, a successful and timely rescue under difficult conditions.

A lack of conflict competence and a culture of conflict avoidance is costing the Irish economy. Civil service human resources officers in Ireland are avoiding conflict as they "do not like tackling underperformance" and fear a "backlash from unions". This avoidance of conflict is contributing to the poor implementation of the Performance Management and Development System. The Secretary General at the Department of Justice, Sean Aylward, describes an "almost congenital disinclination to confront our colleagues with the truth about their performance". This highlights low levels of conflict competence existing in the Irish civil service and a culture of conflict avoidance that is undoubtedly costing the country in terms of poor performance and lower productivity. It is also creating a working environment that is stressful for workers and is not good for their sense of self worth. The ability to have constructive conflict and to hold people accountable for their commitments in the workplace should be a core competence for people in supervisory and management positions. However, this is only part of the solution. There needs to be an integrated conflict management system that fosters conflict competence and the ability to resolve conflict constructively. It cannot be left up to individuals and needs to be lead from the top. Integrated conflict management systems have been introduced in some public services in Australia, Canada and the USA with impressive results. Resort to dispute mechanisms has reduced with an increased use of conflict coaching and mediation. This has reduced costs overall and increased productivity. Conflict coaching is now provided in the US Department of Homeland Security, Australian Defence Department, Victoria Police, Canadian Transport Securities Authority, Department of Environment Climate Change and Water, NSW and the Victorian Electoral Commission. Introducing an integrated conflict management system requires vision and leadership. It requires an analysis of the current system and culture of conflict so that appropriate systems changes and training can be implemented to promote a culture of healthy conflict with greater productivity and team spirit.

This week, however, party preparation began anew. Tables popped up on the South Lawn, installed by staff who had been cut back from in-person work several weeks earlier out of an abundance of caution, but who have returned this week to set up the White House July Fourth party. For White House social secretary Rickie Niceta and the White House team of chefs and butlers, housekeeping staff and ushers, the slow build back to normal begins with a party in the midst of a pandemic. The chairs for the tables, however, are not the typical eight or 10, but instead just four -- only enough to accommodate a socially distant seating plan. There will be tablecloths and flowers, some food -- including grill stations for hot dogs and hamburgers (adorned with tiny American flags attached to toothpicks) and nonalcoholic drinks -- details overseen by Niceta, herself one of the staffers who had since late March been doing her job from home. Waitstaff, who were typically bare-handed for previous outdoor White House events and white-gloved for more formal ones, will this July Fourth be wearing disposable rubber gloves and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-advised face masks, which will be constantly swapped out for fresh ones, a White House official told CNN. The guest list for the picnic will reflect the health trauma the country is still grappling with. "Guests will be made up of front-line workers and their families," deputy press secretary Judd Deere told CNN, "including law enforcement, doctors, nurses and others, as well as members of the military and their families." Members of the Trump administration will also be in attendance, Deere said. Though Deere did not specify how many guests were expected, the White House says the invitation-only event, which culminates in watching flyovers of military aircraft and a large-scale fireworks show on the National Mall, will include social distancing. "As President Trump has said, this year's Independence Day celebration will have a different look than 2019 to ensure the health and safety of those attending," Deere said. Yet Friday evening, Trump, with first lady Melania Trump, attended a program and fireworks display at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, where several thousand were blatantly non-socially distanced, packed closely together in amphitheater-style bleacher seating. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, said earlier in the week during an interview that those who didn't want to maintain the CDC guidelines of staying at least 6 feet apart were welcome to attend. "We told those folks that have concerns that they can stay home. But those who want to come and join us, we'll be giving out free face masks, if they choose to wear one. But we won't be social distancing," Noem said on Fox News. Back at the White House on Thursday, boxes of face masks were being unpacked, thousands of them ready to be placed with hand wipes and sanitizer into personal pouches of protection for each guest. Passing out masks and enforcing personal space feels incongruous at the home of a President who, while publicly saying he is "fine" with the idea of face masks, has shunned wearing one of his own in front of press. In fact, Trump's anti-mask status has helped turn the decision to wear a mask or not into a political issue. The Fourth of July wasn't always as politically charged as it is this year, with a country in the middle of a cultural and social reckoning, as well as a pandemic, and an election looming just four months away. Thomas Jefferson in 1801 was the first American President to hold a July Fourth celebration at the White House, complete with horse races on the North Lawn and the Marine Band (who will also play at Saturday evening's party) performing patriotic tunes in the entrance hall, according to the White House Historical Association's research. In 1850, though at the still-under-construction Washington Monument and not the White House, President Zachary Taylor attended Fourth of July festivities and consumed ice water and cherries and other raw fruit. Taylor died at the White House five days later from a gastrointestinal illness that historians believe to be cholera. Shortly thereafter, in the early 1900s, when the grounds of the White House were virtually open to anyone who wanted to stroll them, the Fourth of July made it a favorite picnic spot, kicking off the tradition of an evening on the sprawling lawn, admiring fireworks that were set off over the National Mall. A favored photo op for many a president and first lady in more recent decades has been standing on the second-floor Truman Balcony of the White House, a spacious outdoor area commissioned by former President Harry Truman in 1947 that extends from the Executive Residence's Yellow Oval Room, looking into the distance at the fireworks. Last year, Trump went all out for the Fourth of July, with an expansive and expensive display of patriotic firepower on the Mall.

Devils Games Game 39: Devils @ Carolina By John Fischer Jan 6, 2009, 9:00am EST Share All sharing options for: Game 39: Devils @ Carolina Expect to see the same New Jersey Devils we saw over the last week or so: Gulitti reports that Colin White did not make the trip and Scott Clemmensen will start in net. How the Devils will play, well, that's not certain. The overtime win against Ottawa wasn't all that and a bag of chips; the win over Montreal was pretty good; and the two games prior didn't feature a lot of defense or smart hockey - especially after a decisive win over Our Hated Rivals. It's been an up-and-down 5 games for the Devils in terms of performance. Yet, they've come out winners for most of them and that's truly the important thing in a results-oriented league like the NHL. Carolina, as you may not have expected, have been the same in terms of results. Check out their last 5 games. Hurricanes' Last 5 Games @ Tampa Bay Sat 01/03 W 3 - 2 St. Louis Fri 01/02 W 2 - 1 Atlanta Wed 12/31 W 3 - 1 Boston Sat 12/27 L 2 - 4 @ Atlanta Fri 12/26 W 5 - 4 OK, not exactly wins over the cream of the crop; but they are wins, they build confidence within a team, and they are worth 2 points regardless of it coming against Tampa Bay or coming against Boston. Believe it, or not, the Hurricanes only sit 4 points behind the Devils in the conference with a record of 20-15-5. And that they have this solid record so far is a testament to the fact that numbers don't always tell the whole story. Let me hit you with some numbers from NHL.com. The Carolina Hurricanes have scored a total of 105 goals, the fourth lowest in the league and tied with the Islanders; while letting in 117 goals in total. That's an average of 2.60 goals per game and 2.82 goals against per game. Much worse than the Devils' 2.97 goals per game and 2.53 goals against per game. The Hurricanes, believe it or not, are worse than the Devils in killing penalties (80.5% to 78.4%) and even on the power play (16.8% to 15.5%). Brutal. Home record for the Hurricanes: 11-9-1. Yep, they just went over .500 at home recently. Here's a fun stat: The Hurricanes win only 50% of the games they score first in - tied with Ottawa for the second worst winning percentage in the entire league in this case. Have another fun one: The Hurricanes have the third worst winning percentage in the NHL when they are leading after the first period with only 53.3% The have the fifth worst winning percentage when leading after two periods: 76.5%. Considering all this, is this really a team that's 20-15-5? They don't score a whole lot of goals, they let in a good amount, their special teams are bad, and it's definitely not a good that scoring first or leading after one doesn't necessarily lead to a good result for Carolina. This is a team that sits seventh in the conference? It is. While they don't look so good statistically after scoring first; they win 50% of the games wherein they let up the first goal. Moreover, they shoot nearly as much as the Devils on average (31.1 to the Devils' 31.2 shots per game) while being almost as stingy in allowing shots from their opponents (Devils: 28.9, Canes: 29.3). And they are playing productive hockey recently. They are 7-3-0 in their last 10 games, and won their last 3. Eric Staal and the potentially ageless Ray Whitney are guys I would ignore on the ice were I looking to lose hockey games easily. 2008 - Ray Whitney 40 12 21 33 -9 8 2 0 1 1 120 10.0 2008 - Eric Staal 40 18 12 30 10 32 7 0 4 0 168 10.7 Basically, when you think you've figured out the 'Canes, you learn some other things about the team that make you scratch your head a second, third, or seventeenth time. All I can really conclude is that this is a game where the old cliche of playing all 60 minutes really comes into play. This is a team that isn't great with a lead, but they aren't hopeless without it; and it's a team that's won quite a few games as of late. Not to mention that Cam Ward has stepped up his game tremendously. Tremendously winning the NHL's third star of the last week. They have momentum. They have a purpose. Should they show up the Devils, it'll send a strong message to the rest of the league that the Southeast is definitely not a one-team division. I feel that the only way you can really counter that without relying on your opponent to fail is to play smart hockey for 60 minutes. Not the first and third period, not for 10 minutes within each period, the whole game as best as possible. It doesn't have to be necessarily aggressive, up tempo, and/or playoff style hockey. It just needs to be smart. It means aiming shots instead of firing them right into the shins of the defense; blocking shots is something Dennis Seidenberg is looking forward to as he's sixth in the league with 92. The Devils would be wise to make sure those efforts hit Ward (and the net, of course) and not some other Hurricane. It means being calm on power plays and setting up the shot. Just like they did to win the game in overtime on Sunday. It requires being aware of who's sneaking in the back door when on defense. Something the Devils got caught on Sunday. Could the Devils beat the Hurricanes. Sure, why not? But don't think the hurricanes are should be an easy two points for the Devils. They have every reason to do well Tuesday night as well. They are at home, they are playing well as of late, and they're better than what some stats currently say about them.
Q: How can I create a folder dynamically during replication? While doing replication I received the following error message in Replication monitor → Agents Access to the path 'D:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\repldata\unc\_DEMO_SAMPLE\20160602154451\' is denied. If the folder is manually created, then the error is solved for some time. However, after some time the error occurs again because the timestamp (20160602154451) has changed. How can I create a folder dynamically? Or can anyone suggest another solution to this problem? A: When installing sql server I always make the UNC folder a shared folder. You either make it RW available to everyone, not big deal for security. Or identify the network login on which the replication agent is using and give it modify access to that folder. This login was set during the sql server install.

His illustrious career continues to be followed closely by sky sports news who have been following his career from his days as a semi professional in England C National Football team to his latest position as a striker of Notts County. Lee Hughes began realizing his dream when he became an integral part of the West Bromwich Albion to get a record fee of 200,000, the highest ever paid to a non-league player. His career continued its upward stream until the car crash that he was involved in and held responsible in the 2003-2004 season. asserted that it had been this crash that changed Hughes life. A passenger, Douglas Graham, inside the Renault that his Mercedes hit, died in the crash and the driver of the Renault was seriously injured. Since Hughes had been drinking that night, he fled from the accident scene to avoid the breath analyzer test. Though he turned himself to the police the following day and was charged with causing death by drunken driving, he was released on bail which allowed him to finish Albions First Division campaign and subsequently be a part of the Premier League. He proceeded to becoming the clubs leading goal scorer with 13 goals. The verdict on the crash was delivered in August 2004 where Hughes was found responsible for the death of Douglas Graham caused by drunken driving and also for fleeing from the crime scene and was sentenced to 6 years of imprisonment and was also banned from driving for ten years. It appeared like the start of his downslide when his contract with West Bromwich Albion was terminated and his appeal to get a reduced sentence refused. While in prison he found salvation in Islam, the faith which he converted to. Alongside, he also played for the Staffordshire County Senior League as part of the prison football team, Featherstone F.C. Days before his release news surfaced of Hughes signing a contract with Oldham Athletic. He did sign a 2 year contract upon his release in August 2007 along with them at 1,800 per week, the total amount being one tenth of what he earned throughout his stint with Wes Bromwich Albion. However, by the time the season ended, Hughes has reclaimed his position as the highest goal scorer for the club, scoring 8 goals. It has been for the upswing for Hughes since then. He joined the Championship Club Blackpool on loan and made his first goal against Charlton Athletic. He was then signed a two year agreement for League Two team for Notts County and scored a hat-trick in a victory over Bradford City with 5-0. Though Hughes finds himself climbing up the ladder of success, he's still haunted by the demons in the past. He still seeks to redeem himself by doing community and charity work in the hope that his work in some way can help prevent another tragedy from happening.

My brother and sister-in-law have recently tried, not very successfully, to raise a little batch of Sea Monkey's. Quite disappointed in the short-lived pets, I was asked how long they typically live for… so I decided to do a bit of research looking into this little species. For many people, their first pet as a child was a little packet of Sea Monkey's; lovingly hatched from the eggs received in the packet, after following all the instructions to prepare the little tank for their home… what most people don't know is, what Sea Monkey's actually are. Whilst doing some research into this post, I have also come to realise that a lot of people (I'm unsure why…) did not even know that Sea Monkey's were living creatures! Sea Monkey's are an invertebrate species, meaning they do not have a backbone. They are arthropods, meaning they have jointed legs. They are a crustacean; related to crabs, shrimp, water fleas, lobsters; with an exoskeleton, an outer shell. When growing, they shed their exoskeleton and regrow a new one to fit their larger size. Until the new exoskeleton hardens, they are more vulnerable. They are also known as, Brine Shrimp. If you have followed any previous posts you may have come across this little titbit of information before, in Something Fishy! (1) – as they are a form of live and frozen fish food. Size wise – females are smaller than males; females growing between 8-12 mm in length, and males growing between 10-15 mm in length. Females have a "lump" at the base of their tail (which is where the eggs are stored), the males do not. Females have small antennae, whilst the males have large, distinct antennae (see image, below). My sister-in-law told me that the packet informed her, that Sea Monkey's can live up to 6 months! That surprised me a bit, as from what I have witnessed and been taught through my studies, is that they typically live 3-5 weeks in the right conditions. The longest I have discovered for the claimed lifespan of the Brine Shrimp is 12 weeks; the average being about 6 weeks. They last about a week in the fridge, in a bag of water for fish food (less if they are not refrigerated)… and approximately 48 hours in freshwater (provided they are not eaten first), as they are not designed to live in freshwater habitats. Basically, don't be too disheartened your Sea Monkey's die before they have reached half of the lifespan given in the information booklet you got with your new pet. Being kept in tiny tanks means that the water needs changing more often, as in such a small space, the water deteriorates quickly. Roughly a 20% water change should be done bi-weekly, to ensure clean water and enough oxygen for survival; so that your Sea Monkey's do not die from suffocation. Adding an aerator into the tank will also keep up oxygen levels, making breathing easier. Doing a water change with such a small animal can be difficult; ensure you do not accidentally throw away any Sea Monkey's with the dirty, discarded water! The shedding of the exoskeleton during growth makes up a lot of the dirtiness of the water, with so many of them shedding around the same time! Deteriorated, dirty water and lack of oxygen, are common causes of premature Sea Monkey death.The tank being knocked over, and therefore spilling your Sea Monkey's everywhere, is a big stress to the little creatures, and ultimately will result in the death of the little guys (and girls)! The stress, combined with not being able to breathe out of water… so ensure your Sea Monkey's are in a safe, secure place where they are unlikely to be knocked over. Other common causes are the tank being in too warm a location; by a window in summer, in a very warm room/ next to a radiator in winter… or being in a location that makes them too cold; in a room not warm enough in winter, in the fridge because they will be fed to my Comet Goldfish within the week. Of course, being used as food is a cause of death, although this does not apply to Brine Shrimp being kept as pet Sea Monkey's! Even though Sea Monkey's are just simple Brine Shrimp, feel free to imagine them how they were advertised in the 60's and 70's (see image, below). – as a cute little family… it may be anthropomorphic, but who doesn't treat their pet a bit human at times?! Have anyone thought of, why sea-monkeys swim this way and not like other shrimps, legs down?

On our last family road trip to Washington we stumbled on the remote town of Forks, the vampire and werewolf capitol of the world (or at least according to Hollywood). So when we packed up for a weekend of clamming near Long Beach I wasn't expecting our trip to rival the freakiness of our previous sojourn. Enter Alligator Man. After harvesting a bounty of four razor clams near Cape Disappointment and freezing our a***es off all night in a tent, we decided to warm our spirits with a visit to a little museum a friend told us about that held Alligator Man - a disturbing mummified half-man half-alligator that may or may not be real. After driving through a few abandoned looking towns with "For Sale" signs up everywhere we arrived in Long Beach and to Marsh's Free Museum which was bustling compared with the rest of town, with a full parking lot and people milling around outside. Marsh's itself is more of a store than anything else selling tacky tourist magnets, stickers, seashells and knickknacks. The actual museum is crammed at the back and at first glance looks like a bunch of garage sale fodder. But we'd heard about Alligator Man and by golly we were going to find him. Past the automated 50s style fortune telling machine and a few taxidermy stuffed animals we found him. He's in a big glass display case, is about four and a half feet long from head to tail and is all black and shriveled like an un-bandaged mummy. The head and upper body probably is from a real human - it's too realistic and well done to be a fake - and the bottom half is obviously from a real alligator. There's no obvious area where you can see that the two have been stuck together - it's a brilliant work of taxidermy if anything else and honestly, it's one of those things that you can't really gauge your emotions on. Did the top human half come from a mummy bought in Egypt way back when? Was someone killed or dug up to make this thing? None of these questions are answered, and Alligator Man just sits there baring his spiky teeth with a half-petrified half-aggressive gape. The funniest part was that even though the museum was packed and Alligator Man was the star attraction, no one seemed to take any notice of him. People casually walked by, stopped to look then moved on. What was going through these people's heads I can hardly imagine: "oh there's a dead human body sewn together with an alligator," or "oh a real-life mutant alien horror movie creature, how nice." And yet, no one gave him a second glance or seemed to register that they were looking at anything odd. Elsewhere in the museum is an even less fawned upon but very real shrunken human head and an utterly ignored taxidermy stuffed six-legged calf. Most visitors seemed to be there to shop, stocking up on "Beer, it's what's for breakfast" bumper stickers and candy. The freakish stuff was just a sideshow at the back of a room. I studied primatology at University so it had been a long-time dream of mine to see proboscis monkeys in the wild. Bako National Park in Sarawak, Borneo, Malaysia, did not disappoint. A proboscis family was out foraging in the mangroves near park headquarters every morning and there was a plethora of other fascinating critters to be seen as well. Note: I have a larger article on Bako in the works and I'll post a link once it's been published.

Sean regularly gets called up for TV slots but today we're very happy to draw attention to Sean's work alongside Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo on the Substantive Research Website.

Read the full article HERE and thanks for the recognition to Substantive Research – a top notch website and one you should certainly have an eye on.
For more than 70 years, the Lighthouse Camp on the Barnegat Bay was a summer retreat for the blind and multiply-handicapped. When the camp was closed, owner Lighthouse International worked with TPL to protect the 90-acre site and to find an alternative use for the camp's 27 buildings in August 2000. The land is now owned by the New Jersey Division of Fish & Wildlife, which will lease the buildings to a local environmental non-profit for conferences and natural resource education.

In 2019 EMEA's leading tech summit with focus on marketing and digital business will emphasize the importance of trust in the further development of the digital economy. Companies need the trust of users in order to offer successful products and services. Users must be able to trust that companies treat their data respectfully and responsibly. In addition the industry needs the confidence of society that digitisation will bring more advantages than disadvantages. "Our motto this year, 'Trust in You', is intended to encourage each individual and the community as a whole. I believe the members of the DMEXCO community are aware of their responsibility to society, businesses and individuals. They are committed to equality and discover the benefits of new technologies and how to use them. DMEXCO in Cologne is among one of the places where people are able to do so", says Dr. Dominik Matyka, Chief Advisor of DMEXCO. DMEXCO opens Ticketshop in June and launches App with new functionalities This year the DMEXCO online ticket shop will open by the end of June. The two-day ticket with unlimited access to the trade fair and conference will cost 129 euros. Trade visitors who only book the second day of the fair will pay only 79 euros.

In addition, users regularly receive current content, exciting deals, people news and event content.

These includes companies such as Asana, AT&T, About You, Baidu, Intelligent Apps/MyTaxi and Slack," adds Christoph Menke, Director Sales & Operations at DMEXCO. New format for corporate venture capital Also new in 2019 is the CVC Side Conference: for the first time DMEXCO invites managers of corporate venture capital companies to a half-day conference. Limited, concentrated and with a clear focus on strategic investments, this new format should not only inform and inspire the participants. The focus will also be on networking with each other and actively connecting with the more than 150 national and international DMEXCO start-ups. Matthias Wahl, President of the German Association for the Digital Economy (BVDW e.V.) adds: "Trust is the indispensable basis for the success of the digital industry, because we are breaking 'new territory' every day. Confidence in the implementation of promising ideas, confidence in the regulatory framework and the support of politicians, confidence in the success of one's own performance. With this year's motto 'Trust in You', this claim finds a home at DMEXCO. We will be presenting everything that can strengthen confidence in the digital future".

Having fished on a Berkshire pit on and off for three years I had one remaining member of the A-team left to catch, the big one known as the Brute. I felt that the Brute was more likely to trip up to a bottom bait and was using a new rig, which is very similar to one that I saw Adam Penning write about a few months back and had already had two good mirrors using it on the first two trips. The bait is mounted on a soft hair made from 18lb Gravel Super Natural and trapped on the bend of a size-8 Choddy hook with a small length of silicone. I tie this to a two-inch length of 25lb Mouth Trap, which is then joined to a six-inch length of coated braid. Lastly, the Mouth Trap is gently curved. I found the Brute along with three other fish in the bay enjoying the Autumn sun and spent all afternoon up and down a tree waiting patiently to cast in. I'd tied one of the rigs, helicopter style onto five feet of leadcore with a 2oz lead to cut down on disturbance. My chance came when they drifted out of the bay and casting the marker float long to the far side of the bay I wound it back to the middle and let it drop. A good thud was felt. I then drew it back over the sandy area that I knew was there and popped the float up at the smoothest point. A single cast with a three-bait parachute stringer was good enough as it landed behind the float and a nice 'dink' was felt as the lead hit bottom. Fifteen baits completed the trap. The take came just before 8am and was a ripper. I was on it straight away it took 40 yards off me straight away before I could tighten the clutch. The fight was all out in the lake and when, about five minutes in, I got it in close, up she popped and that huge scale on its flank identified that my quest was nearly over. She carried on wallowing to the net and a "Yeeeessss!!" echoed over the noise of the motorway, followed by the 'Brute' shout once I was 100 per cent certain. At a personal best 48lb 2oz, she looked immaculate and a couple of hours later, after making tea for the lads, I closed the gate on that chapter of my angling. Job done!
Q: How do I find the path of a file on another computer on my network? I would like to access files from another computer on the same network in the Terminal. But I am not sure of the path to those files. How do I find it? A: It would depend on how you want to access the file. Here's what I do: * *Initiate the connection to the remote computer (I do it via Finder -> Go -> Connect to Server [or Command+K]) but you can also do via terminal using the mount command *Connect to the shared folder/volume available to your user *When connecting to those in Terminal, you would now use the path /Volumes/[name of folder]/[rest_of_path_here] to access them. For example, if you connected to a folder called Stuff with a subfolder called Things, and ultimately file jackpot.txt on ip 10.10.1.5, first connect via smb to the server (10.10.1.5), choose the folder Stuff, and then reference that path in Terminal as /Volumes/Stuff/Things/jackpot.txt EDIT: You can also run a Find command (Command + F) inside of Finder while you are connected to the share if you still don't know where the file is. Do the following: * *Open Finder, connect to the server/volume (Steps 1+2 above) *Run Command+F to Find, enter your search term *Above the Finder section where files display, switch the search to "Shared" - this will run the search against connected volumes *Locate the file you want, and then drag+drop it into an open Terminal window *The path will be shown in Terminal A: In addition to drag and drop, you can right click on any Finder window, select "Customize Toolbar," and add the "Path" drop-down button. It won't show a path you can copy-paste like in Windows, but it will give a better idea of the path to a folder you're in.
If you are looking for a relaxing screensaver or video for your TV and computer screens; this is a great choice. The setting is a simple English stream. The camera is focused in on the mini waterfall and the grass at the edges is allowed to go out of focus. This creates a simple but effective background video which has an artistic effect because we used our aperture setting to alter the depth of field view. The sound is simply the water trickling down the rocks and along the stream. Sometimes the best things in life are the most simple ones. This download is a great way to de-stress. The 20 minute MP4 video can be set to loop on media players or SMART TVs, and the self looping screensaver comes in both Windows and Mac versions. The footage is full HD so the video can be played on even a large HDTV or SMART TV. The Lake District in England is one of the most beautiful places in the country and a must see if you ever visit. I have been lucky enough to take a few trips there in my life and this time I was there on a day trip with some friends. I brought my camera with me on a lovely walk and had the opportunity to take a couple of videos of some quaint little streams running through the hills. We started out at a lovely little pub called The Pheasant in Bassenthwaite Lake, Cockermouth. After a good hearty meal we decided to take a walk through the hills and came across a great little spot leading down to the lake. My friends went ahead whilst I stayed behind to film a little brook that we passed along the way. I really loved this spot as I knew I would not be disturbed thanks to the remote and quiet location. It was a warm summers day with a touch of scattered cloud and all the insects were buzzing around the water, a perfect place for a relaxing screensaver. It felt completely idyllic and I settled down along the lush grassy banks with my Canon 5D Mark III. I really wanted to do something different with this video and spotted a few small falls where the water was tricking over the rocks. A small aperture seemed wrong for this setting as the focus was most certainly these lovely little water falls on the stream. I knew I really wanted to open up the iris so I pulled out my 100mm macro, a perfect lens for sharp detail and a shallow depth of field. I wanted the grass to feel dreamy whilst at the same time capture the crisp clarity in the water and rocks. I lay down perching the camera within the grass and pulled focus onto my perfect spot. It looked just like I imagined, perhaps even better and the sound of the water was Zen like. I honed in my settings and began to film. As I lay there in the sun in this blissful setting, the light faded in and out as the clouds passed over. I almost fell asleep I was so relaxed and as I packed up my things and walked briskly down the stream, I felt at one and in harmony with nature.
As a homeowner, you'll sometimes want lots of air and a place to lean on while watching the sunset. Other times, you'll want to keep the wind at bay and your neighbors' eyes away. Regardless of your needs, the Infinity from Marvin's ultrex fiberglass tilt turn and hopper windows are the solution. Designed for multiple scenarios, they are some of the most practical, flexible and ingenious devices your house must have. It can be swung like a door, or its top of the sash can be tilted into the room for ventilation under the control of one handle. The Tilt Turn is perfect as an emergency exit access and ensures easy cleaning, while the Tilt-In Hopper by Marvin completes the package by offering additional air and light. We provide variation to our Tilt and Turn products. You can pick what best suits your needs by visiting our Amazing Exteriors office. Each window is customized to your exact specifications. The Tilt Turn opens like a door when you turn the handle. Turn it some more to tilt the top in and allow generous air exchange by locking the bottom sash into the frame. The Standard Tilt Turn with Keyed locks brings a bonus by allowing stationary unit security along with in-swing convenience. The Simulated Double Hung, having the Tilt Turn function incorporated, will provide a more traditional look. However, if you strive for an extra ounce of elegance, add a Round Top Tilt Turn to your windows mix. No matter what your main choices are, you just have to add a Hopper window in the equation. The Tilt-in Hopper can successfully be used as a ventilating transom. If you have a big space intended for large openings and the traditional double hung windows are not practical, opt for the Clad Simulated Double Hung Hopper. You won't be short of natural light and fresh air. Last but not least, we present to you the Inswing Hopper. It can be used as a unique solution on its own or as part of a creative series, although most of our clients preferred it as a venting transom over one of their doors. Multiple design possibilities are open for all of the above products. So, pick between bronze, white, satin chrome, and brass for your Tilt Turn Handle. On the other hand, choose between bronze and white for your Keyed Handle. However, if you want to add some extra personality to your project you should direct your attention to the designer handles provided by the Marvin Architectural Hardware. Even those come in diversity as you can get either one of the four finishes: Solid Dark Silicon, Natural Nickel, Charcoal Black Nickel or, Light Antique Nickel. At Amazing Exteriors, we provide a range of glazing options so that our windows can meet the performance challenges of any climate. We ensure that you make the optimal and cost-saving energy-efficiency choice by ordering your Tilt Turn & Hopper Windows with argon insulating glass from our office.

Don't be too surprised to notice more color in your house. Those pesky UV rays were fading away the coloring in your furniture. By opting for a Low-E glass, you simply protect your health and the beauty of your belongings. Extremely common in the continental Europe, the tilt and turn windows have made their way to the United States of America. They are practical and easy to clean. They are the ultimate in versatility as the special hardware allows you to easily operate them as a top-venting hopper window or an inswing casement. Enjoy an increase in air circulation with the Infinity Tilt Turn & Hopper Windows by Marvin. Your home will have a nice and cool interior thanks to windows such as the transom types.

They bring in cool breezes and let hot air out. Ample fresh air can pass into the room when the window is opened like a casement. The tilt function comes handy as a precaution against small children falling through the window or against intruders willing to enter the room. One cannot climb out the window and fit through the small opening, but the ventilation function is entirely preserved. Due to its many benefices and its versatility, this type of window can be used for almost any room in a house or apartment.If you have a window project in mind, Amazing Exteriors of can help you design the perfect windows to help meet and exceed all your design requirements.

Costa Rica News – Three San Jose markets are preparing for a great change. They will, over some time, become an attractive tourist loop. The circuit for visitors to travel will connect the Borbón, Central and Coca Cola markets. The idea to refurbish them is part of an ITCR project called Strengthening Territorial Urban Public Management. Each will be transformed, all the while respecting their history and culture and making sure they don't end up looking like malls. They will attract tourists as cultural epicenters where one can eat a local meal and take a part of the country home. Borbón will get a central lobby and an elevator so as to get more people to the infrequently used second floor. The corridors will be made more accessible and surfaces made uniform. At Coca Cola, the work will be done on the building and the mobility around it. The Central Market's updates are still unknown, as there is no budget yet.

WMAQ-TV reports that Noah Inman was playing basketball on July 1 when he suddenly fell to the ground in Hammond, Indiana. The city is about 25 miles south of Chicago. Witnesses called an ambulance, thinking he'd suffered a seizure. Hospital workers soon discovered he'd been hit by a falling bullet. Noah was flown to a Chicago hospital. On Friday, he was pronounced dead by the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office. Police say an investigation determined the bullet had likely been fired skyward, like fireworks. It's illegal to discharge a weapon within Hammond's city limits. The case remains under investigation. Gage Larvadain staying busy while doing two sports at Southeastern
Latest News About Black Holes In a typical star, nuclear fusion is liable for generation of vitality and pressure. This is an outward strain that neutralizes the gravitational pull created by the star's personal mass. Related Space Facts: But the mathematics of black holes was extremely complex. Many researchers believed they have been nothing greater than mathematical artefacts, current solely on paper. Two gaseous clouds resembling peacocks have been found in neighboring dwarf galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud. In these photographs by the ALMA telescopes, purple and inexperienced spotlight molecular gas while blue exhibits ionized hydrogen gasoline. A shut-up view of an interstellar comet passing by way of our photo voltaic system may be seen on the left. On the best, astronomers used an image of Earth for comparability. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope captured the Tarantula Nebula in two wavelengths of infrared mild. The purple represents sizzling fuel, while the blue regions are interstellar dust. This is an artist's impression of two white dwarfs within the strategy of merging. While astronomers anticipated that this may cause a supernova, they have found an instance of two white dwarf stars that survived merging. This type of explosion is referred to as a fast blue optical transient. The afterglow of brief gamma ray burst that was detected 10 billion gentle-years away is shown right here in a circle. The purple supergiant star Betelgeuse, in the constellation of Orion, skilled unprecedented dimming late in 2019. The more telescopes within the array that are extensively spaced, the higher the image decision. Learning about mysterious constructions in the universe supplies perception into physics and permits us to test observation strategies and theories, such as Einstein's principle of basic relativity. Its unique capabilities are revolutionizing astronomy as Hubble continues humanity's quest to explore the universe. With imaginative and prescient that spans the ultraviolet by way of visible and into the near infrared, Hubble investigates every thing from black holes to planets round other stars. After the supernova explosion, fusion response is totally absent. When a star dies and this explosion occurs, the majority of the whole mass of star is thrown out into the void of the house whereas solely a chilly remnant stays back. This remaining part of the star doesn't experience any fusion reaction that used to provide it life. The imaging methods used to capture the photograph reveal that the supermassive black hole has a hoop-like structure and a shadow, which is represented by a darkish central area. Planets round a photo voltaic-mass stars can develop until they start accreting gas and turn into large planets similar to Jupiter, in a couple of millions of years. But we thought that small stars such asProxima, TRAPPIST-1, TeegardernÕs star and GJ 3512, could not form Jupiter mass planets. This is an artist's illustration of what a Neptune-size moon would appear to be orbiting the gasoline giant exoplanet Kepler-1625b in a star system 8,000 mild-years from Earth. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array captured this unprecedented image of two circumstellar disks, in which child stars are rising, feeding off material from their surrounding birth disk. It took researchers a long time to realise they might persist in the actual world. With the new 'black hole Sun' having the same mass as the original Sun, the gravitational pull on Earth will stay the same. Black Holes are very very similar to spheres and not funnels as illustrated in many text books. This image was taken in January utilizing the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. For greater than 50 years, physicists had suspected that there could also be a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. But the know-how needed to catch up earlier than this idea might be demonstrated.

After the final whistle blew on senior Katie Briglia's season during the field hockey team's 5–2 loss to Massachusetts in the first round of the Atlantic 10 Conference Championships on Nov. 2, she said more good than bad came out of the year. With a 12–9 record, the 2012 season proved to be one of the program's best years under coach Amanda Janney. Since 1992, the field hockey team has had three seasons with 12 or more wins and all three years Janney was the coach. The 12-win total from this season was the most since 2007 when the Owls went 15–6. But having a winning record would be tough with a schedule that had Temple facing seven teams ranked in the Top 20 nationally. There to answer any doubts Janney had about having a winning season was sophomore forward Amber Youtz. As of Oct. 29, Youtz led her team and conference with 21 goals, ranking sixth in NCAA Division I with 1.05 goals per game, and her team and conference best 52 total points ranked seventh in the nation with 2.60 points per game. When she scored two goals within a minute of each other in Temple's season opener against No. 8 Virginia, Youtz began her breakout season. The Dauphin, Pa., native went on to have a record-breaking season that was highlighted on a weekend late in September when Youtz had back-to-back hat trick performances. By the time playoffs rolled around, Youtz was ranked amongst the top scorers in the nation. Youtz's 22 goals and 54 points this season are the fifth highest single-season totals in Temple history. Beyond Youtz's breakout year, other young players were able to step up as well. Both Janney and Briglia said sophomore midfielder Nicole Kroener and freshman midfielder Taylor Schronk, were integral parts of the team. Kroener and Schronk started in all 21 games for the Owls, and Kroener was tied for second on the team with 10 assists. Youtz was named as the A-10 Offensive Player of the Year, and both Youtz and Briglia were given A-10 First Team honors. Freshman forward Alyssa Delp and Schronk were named to the A-10 All-Rookie Team. For women, path to postseason goes through conference tournament.
Good friend Stacey requested some photos of our new home. I thought that would be a great blog post idea, until I realized that this would require the house to be in a state worthy of having pictures taken that I was willing to post to the Internet. Let's just say that this level of tidiness happens, um, not every day. So instead Markus, Annie and I headed out for a short walk behind our house and took some photos. I just love the views from our neighbourhood, Arzl. Much of our view from our yard is blocked by an old house, but you can see a couple of mountains if you stand in just the right place. Select view from our yard. A short walk up the lane begins a path that first snakes through the cow pastures and then merges with the larger mountain system of trails. This last picture turned out to be a bit boring. I was trying to capture the awesome hill that I think will be perfect for Annie to slide down on her plastic Rutschblatt. (What do you call it is English? Magic carpet?) I'm hoping the path leading through the pasture is kept up, as I can see many afternoons of Annie and I climbing up and sliding down, and climbing up and sliding down. Repeat until one of us loses the feeling in our toes or bum. I do miss the views of the ocean, but the mountains are a close substitute in terms of beauty. For all of our personal trials, it is hard not to feel blessed to live in this part of the world. Maybe not forever, but I'm enjoying it while we are here. When Ryan read that I was posting every day, he must have been thinking about his upcoming visit because his request was for a post about bread. Because really, the bread here is something to look forward to. It is fantastic. And it is everywhere. I've found good bread in Victoria and Winnipeg and London (Wildfire, Tall Grass Prairie and the Portuguese Bakery respectively), but you have to look for it and sometimes go out of your way for it. Bread here is very important and very available. There are bakeries every few blocks. (They are like 7-Elevens in Winnipeg.) Even in the airport they have mini-ovens so that the bread can come out fresh for the tired travelers. It matters here. (I've never heard an Austrian talk about a low-carb diet.) This isn't true everywhere in Europe either. Italy, home of fantastic food, serves mostly white bread. Tasty, but white. When Ryan and Renata come, they slip out to the bakery every morning and pick up a warm loaf. One of Ryan's favourites is a sunflower bread called Sonnenkraftbrot (sun-strength bread). It has a chewy crust and a soft but dense center. We've also tried, and like, potato bread, walnut bread and even the Bauernbrot (farmer's bread) is great with cheese and cold cuts. Although I've branched out more lately, the first year I was here I was addicted to Wurzelbrot ("root bread" because of the shape), which I guess technically is a white bread but tastes so lovely. And it even tastes great toasted the next day, as bakery-fresh bread here does not stay fresh very long. No preservatives. Often times Austrians (including this little family) will have a simple dinner of good bread, cheese, and cold cuts. Delicious. So we are looking forward to your visit Ryan and Renata. Your bread awaits. You are currently browsing the archives for the Innsbruck category.
Photocopies, Patents, and Knowledge Transfer: "The Uneasy Case" of Justice Breyer's Patentable Subject Matter Jurisprudence Dmitry Karshtedt One aspect of Justice Stephen Breyer's discomfort with patents, as expressed in his opinion for the Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus and his dissent from the order dismissing certiorari in LabCorp v. Metabolite, is strikingly similar to one of his critiques of copyright law in The Uneasy Case for Copyright, a well-known article he wrote as Professor Breyer more than forty-five years ago. In The Uneasy Case, Breyer argued that the burdens on duplication of technical articles imposed by copyright law restrict the flow of information and prevent scientists from enjoying spillover benefits of published research. His patent opinions on the Supreme Court, too, talk of diminished access to information resulting from intellectual property protection. In this Article, I contend that the parallel that Justice Breyer implicitly draws between the harms of copyright and patent is a questionable one. In particular, Justice Breyer's opinions on patentable subject matter do not address the notion that inducement of disclosure and dissemination of information is one of the very purposes of patent law, nor the idea that there are many noninfringing uses of information contained in patents. I argue that these omissions may provide an insight into Justice Breyer's patent law jurisprudence-particularly, the recent reinvigoration of limits on patentable subject matter in his opinion for the Court in Mayo.

New to the gym? We speak to a personal trainer in Western Sydney, Nabil Touma about the benefits of resistance training and how to implement it into your training routine when you're just starting on your fitness journey. Resistance training is also commonly referred to as strength training or weight training. It's a type of physical exercise which uses resistance through weight to build strength, anaerobic endurance, and increase muscle mass. It can be done using weights, or even your own body weight. Nabil, Planet Fitness Personal Trainer in Western Sydney, says there are many benefits to resistance training. "Resistance training can help you increase muscle mass and muscle fibres, regulate the sugar level by helping insulin sensitivity, increase your bone strength, build self esteem, create more lean body mass, improve flexibility and balance, protect you from injuries, and much more," Nabil says. In addition, the more muscle mass you have, the higher your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is too, which means you are burning more calories even at rest. Strength training is beneficial for women as well as men, and Nabil says it is essential to include it in your exercise program – regardless of your age or ability. There are many misconceptions around resistance and weight training, and Nabil, personal trainer in Western Sydney says he hears a lot of first time gym goers, and even those who have been working out for years mention the same concerns. "Some people think resistance training will make them gain fat, which is not true," Nabil says. Women in particular worry that weight lifting will make them 'bulky'. But, unless you are doing very heavy weights and following a calorie-dense diet, it is very unlikely. Muscle and fat are completely different structures, so it's not possible for one to turn into the other. When it comes to injury, while it is essential that weights are used properly, and it's best to speak to your personal trainer in any of our locations if you're not sure, building muscle will help to prevent injury to joints – which is especially important as we age. What Exercises Should I Start With? If it is your first time attempting resistance training, our personal trainer suggests some simple exercises using body weight to start: push ups, squats, and walking and reverse walking lunges. These simple exercises are easy, as well as highly effective, targeting all areas of the body. If you're in the gym and still unsure, any one of our personal trainers in Western Sydney, Newcastle and the Central Coast can show you these basic moves. How Frequently Should I Be Doing Resistance Training? Our Personal Trainer in Western Sydney, Nabil, says three times a week is ideal. Want to Speak to a Personal Trainer and Get Started with Resistance Training? We have personal trainers at all of our locations, including gyms in Western Sydney, Central Coast, and three gyms in Newcastle. If you would like to have a program customised for you, or would like to know more about resistance training, or about any other type of training, our personal trainers can help. Get in touch with us, or come and say hello to a personal trainer at your nearest Planet Fitness gym.

Package contains 0.5 grams, approximately 4,500 Oregano, Greek Herb Seeds. Germination: 12 - 18 days. Sprinkle seeds on well- prepared, light soil. Greek oregano is a hardy herb that is native to the Mediterranean. This variety of oregano forms into a bush naturally, but it can be cultivated so that it grows lower to the ground. Because of this Greek oregano can be used successfully as a ground cover in your yard. Oregano is a perennial herb that sports lovely flowers and aromatic green leaves. It works well in a garden or in a container. This herb has become very popular in cooking, particularly in Italian dishes, although is has also been known as a medicinal plant. Some also find oregano helpful in companion planting. Oregano is a hardy plant that is drought tolerant and fairly easy to grow. It can spread out or grow into a bush shape, depending on how you cultivate it. Plant oregano in a sunny spot with well-drained soil. You can trim it back as needed. The leaves of the oregano plant can be harvested often. Cut stems from the pant right before it is ready to bloom, since this is the time when the taste will be the strongest. You can use the herb fresh, or dry the leaves and store for later. You can also refrigerate fresh leaves or store them in the freezer. Use oregano in sauces, on meats, on vegetables, in Italian and Greek dishes, and even as a tea. Combine all ingredients together in a bowl, then transfer to a baking dish. Bake uncovered at 425F for about 50 minutes, stirring the mixture at least once during cooking. Potatoes are ready when they are tender. Serves 4.

Based on customer reviews, it is without a doubt that Puffy mattress is one of the most comfortable mattresses that you could ever purchase. They claim it's very similar to resting on clouds.Furthermore, customers who state they suffer from back pain, really feel that it is alleviated with Puffy's Adaptive Flexible Cloud Technology. Puffy mattress offers a lifetime warranty, along with a 101 night sleep trial. Puffy's top layer is CertiPUR-US Certified, and is made of Cooling Cloud Relief Foam.This layer is the reason it feels as if you are sleeping on a cloud.The bottom layer of Puffy is made of Firm Core Support Foam, which is also CertiPUR-US certified. They were one of online's first brands to sell mattresses. With a lineup of six beds that were different, Nest mattresses are made with every sleeper in your mind. The Nature's Sleep mattress differs from many mattress brands on the marketplace, as it's made with 4 layers of foam.Nature's 4 layers provide support for individuals who are heavier. These 4 layers also help by decreasing motion transfer significantly. The Nature's Sleep mattress includes a 20 year warranty, compared with the majority of mattresses using a 10 year. This mattress is a little more costly than some.Butthis warranty, in addition to being made with emerald gel makes this mattress well worth the added price. The 2 biggest aspects when looking to purchase a new mattress, is comfort and also support.There are a few things that should take place when you lie down. You want the sinkage and contour to be right, for proper spine alignment. You also want a mattress to correctly support your body, as you sleep at night. Proper alignment from head to toe is essential for balanced and healthy rest and to decrease neck and back pain. While a mattress is being supportive, it is important that it provides you with stress relief also. Stress points are what causes you to move around through out the night, while you are attempting to sleep. Memory foam mattresses have earned their way into the spotlight, by not only being comfortable, but as equally supportive. This goes hand in hand with comfort and support. A mattress should neither be too hard or too soft.In order to keep your body and spine in the correct alignment, your mattress should be as neutral as it can be.Too much rigidity in a mattress will irritate the stress factors, creating pinched nerves, in addition to the blood to stop flowing. If you commonly get up with the feeling of pins and needles on your body, it is probably from the mattress being as well rigid. And if you wake up with frequent back pain, most likely this is because your mattress is too soft. This results in a concaving effect, like a hammock. Which makes your spine be out of alignment.It's important to locate a mattress with a neutral feeling, that will definitely be both rigid and also soft in the right places. It's not a big surprise, that if you're in the market for a high quality mattress, it usually comes with a nice price tag.It's a big investment to make, so once you purchase one, it is crucial to find a mattress that will definitely last you for years.It is very important that you find a mattress that has been constructed to last a long period of time. guarantee.
You know that feeling you get at 6 AM on Monday morning when you have to drag yourself out of bed and get yourself ready for work? Sometimes it can be the most depressing moment of the week. Some of us have noticed that sinking feeling starts to creeps in on Sunday night. Many people fantasize about a 4-day work week to alleviate this feeling but that would just delay the depression until Tuesday morning. It is not the day of the week that we have a problem with; it is simply the fact that our freedom has ended and we must now get back into robot mode at work. The past 10 years of career coaching has revealed to me how many people, in various levels, are miserable at work. Many of them blame their boss or their coworkers for their misery. Some claim to be bored or express feelings similar to professional claustrophobia. I define professional claustrophobia as a feeling of being kept in the same role, performing the same mundane tasks, turning in the same redundant reports with no challenges. I would wager that the majority of workers feel stuck in their current role, at least one time in their career. After-all, if you do the same exact thing every day for 5 days a week, 50 weeks out of the year, you are almost guaranteed to get bored. Should you leave your growth, satisfaction and overall happiness completely in the hands of your boss and coworkers? Of course not. If your work life is boring, find ways to excite your personal life. If your work life is hectic, focus on relaxation in your personal life. Keep in mind that your job is simply one part of you. It does not completely define you. You are in charge of your own career and happiness. If your job is boring, look for ways you can spice it up. Ask your manager if you can cross-train in a different department. Volunteer to spearhead the next major project. Interview one of the senior leaders in your organization and ask him to be your mentor. Make a list of some of the major challenges facing your department or your organization and offer to create a team to resolve them.
The Hello Bitches Tour (stylized as Hello Bi+ches Tour) was the debut concert tour of South Korean singer CL. The tour visited nine cities in 2016 in the United States and Canada, kicking off in New York City's Hammerstein Ballroom on October 29 and concluding in Toronto at the Sound Academy on November 14. The tour was promoted by SIVA Entertainment Group. The setlist consisted of her solo songs along with many of her previous works with K-pop girl group 2NE1. Background and development On September 23, 2016, YG Entertainment announced that CL would hold her first American tour. She will visit nine cities in North America, with a total of nine shows. The tour's name derives from CL's 2015 Korean language single "Hello Bitches". The tour's announcement followed the release of CL's debut American single "Lifted" on August 19, amid news of an upcoming English-language debut EP. The sold-out show at the Hammerstein Ballroom made her the first Korean female singer to play a solo concert at a major venue in New York City. An unreleased music video of "Hello Bitches" was also played during the tour. Controversy On November 7, fans and concertgoers had noticed that CL had been using the "controversial" version of her song "MTBD (Mental Breakdown)" since the tour started. CL apologized on her Twitter account stating that her "engineer [had] sent the old version for [the] tour". CL performed the alternative version for the later shows. Set list "Fire" (Intro) "Can't Nobody" "Scream" "I Am the Best" "Come Back Home" "I Don't Care (Reggae Ver.)"

A new report from the Anti-Defamation League says white supremacists have increased their recruitment efforts at colleges like never before under President Trump's watch. According to the ADL, 290 incidents involving posters, banners and other materials featuring racist propaganda were recorded in 2017. In 2016, that number was 56. "White supremacists are targeting college campuses like never before," said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt in a statement. "They see campuses as a fertile recruiting ground, as evident by the unprecedented volume of propagandist activity designed to recruit young people to support their vile ideology." With the report including every institution from Ivy League schools to community colleges, Texas and California saw the most incidents by far in 2017, with 61 and 43 respectively. Pennsylvania is third with 18. However, only six states in the entire country were without any incident. Of all the incidents that have occurred over the last two years, the ADL claims the white supremacist group Identity Evropa was responsible for nearly half of them. Discussing their style of propaganda, the organization says Identity Evropa prefers to avoid messages that are immediately recognizable as hate-filled, instead employing "black and white images of classical sculptures, including Michelangelo's David or Nicolas Coustou's Julius Caesar." Meanwhile, groups that more openly embrace Nazi ideals such as Atomwaffen Division, which has ties to as many as five murders in eight months, "use blatantly violent and offensive imagery like blood-splattered swastikas." Trump has more than struggled to condemn the rise of white supremacists during his time in the White House. On the night of Aug. 11, 2017, when tiki torch-wielding racists marched near the University of Virginia, the usually loquacious Twitter user was silent. The next day, after a morning in which white nationalists clashed with counter-protesters and violence overtook the streets of Charlottesville, Va., Trump finally made a statement on social media, saying, "We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!" and later adding, in part, "Charlottesville sad!" In preparation for President Trump's upcoming visit, Identity Evropa members in San Diego went to the Mexican border to check out the wall prototypes and demonstrate against ANY form of amnesty. Tragically, just moments after posting that last message, one of the "alt-right" attendees aimed his vehicle at a crowd of anti-Nazi demonstrators, injuring dozens and taking the life of 32-year-old civil rights activist Heather Heyer. Given the opportunity to address the nation later that day, Trump decided against singling out white supremacists, saying instead, "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides — on many sides." The President has continued to receive support from prominent racists such as former KKK leader David Duke, who just Tuesday lauded the State of the Union address and how it declared, "Americans are dreamers too." Also picking up on that specific line was one of the leaders of the Charlottesville white supremacist rally, Richard Spencer. Thank you President Trump. Americans are "Dreamers" too. After the State of the Union, Spencer tweeted out a picture of a smiling white family along with a caption quoting Trump. Thus far, the ADL says 15 on-campus incidents have already taken place this year.

Q: Flask: button to update value in database so I currently pull a value from a database and display it on the screen. I have a HTML button right next to it that is supposed to increase the score on the screen by 1 every time I click it. Currently, when I click the button nothing happens. The number on the screen stays the same. Python file @app.route('/') def layout(): db = get_db() try: cur1 = db.execute('SELECT score FROM {tn} where name="Tyler"'.format(tn="Score")) score1 = cur1.fetchone() if request.method == 'POST': db.execute('UPDATE {tn} SET score=score+1 WHERE name="Tyler"'.format(tn="Score")) db.commit() except: flash("This person doesn't exist in our database!") return render_template('layout.html', score1=score1) HTML file <form action="{{ url_for('layout') }}" method="post"> <p align="center">Tyler</p> <div align="center"> <tr> <td>{{ score1.score }}</td> </tr> &nbsp; &nbsp; <button type="button">+1</button> </div> </form> Any help is appreciated. Thank you. Edit: updated view and HTML. Same issue. A: Your two view functions are mapped to the same route; but a URL can only be served by one view. Either map your increaseScore1 function to a different route, or combine the logic in one function which checks if the method is POST and updates the score if so, otherwise just displays it.
Domenico Codispoti is an Italian man under house arrest for a variety of crimes, including petty theft and drug dealing. Signor Codispoti, 48, is homeless. Every night at 9pm, he settles down in front of number 22 Via Vittor Pisani in Milan and arranges his blankets and sleeping bag. He isn't allowed to move until 7am the next morning. Police patrols check after sunset to make sure he's "at home." "I have always done my stealing at night," he says. "That's why the court gave me this sentence. Since I don't have a house, there was no other solution left. During the night I can't move, I have to stay here, stuck on this sidewalk." The unusual punishment was first imposed on Codispoti in 2006, when he was sentenced to two years of surveillance and house arrest. After a few more run-ins with the law, Codispoti's sentence was extended. He must now sleep in this particular spot near Milan's Central Station until April 2014. He should just start building a structure.
Toribio Marín, Carmen (2016). The Fourfold Water Garden, a Renaissance Invention. "Gardens and Landscapes of Portugal", v. 4 (n. 1); pp. 1-15. ISSN 2182-942X. https://doi.org/10.1515/glp-2016-0001. The different combinations between the "classic" fourfold pattern and water in the garden have produced a high number of varied solutions since the distant past. However, during the Renaissance a new model emerges: a crossaxial garden with four basins arranged symmetrically around its center. The composite analysis of the related examples is addressed in this paper, which attempts to find an explanation for the different models as for the appearance of the contrasting solution at the same time in two different locations: the Villa Lante (Bagnaia, Italy) and the Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo in El Escorial (Madrid, Spain).

It's Monday. Politics is more vicious than ever. So here's something a little lighter. You can check it out, here. Here's something that's been happening since the beginning of gay time. Not big deal. Over 3,000 people participated in the survey, which was conducted earlier this month. One if four respondents admitted they had lied about their age at least once while chatting with a potential new hookup. Here's the link. Lucille Ball once said that she couldn't lie about her age because she told too many people her real age when she first went to Hollywood. But she wished she hadn't told the truth back then. This one is for all the transphobes in Scotland. 'Dear transphobes, do you think it's right to harass people on the street?' the poster reads. 'Right to push transgender people around in clubs?

Home»Hot Copy»Lucas Garrett: GF musician's Caffe Lena solo debut, album, unique sound Lucas Garrett: GF musician's Caffe Lena solo debut, album, unique sound December 1, 2022 Hot Copy Lucas Garrett graduated from Glens Falls Hall in 2011, went to SUNY Adirondack for Science and earned his Bachelor's degree in applied mathematics from SUNY Empire in 2017 — but music is his passion and his career. He has his solo debut at Caffe Lena, the storied coffeehouse in Saratoga Springs, tonight, Thursday, Dec. 1. The 7 p.m. show is a release party for Reaching Through Dreams, Lucas' latest album, what he describes as a very personal collection of six original songs. (Tix: $16, $8 child; info: caffelena.org.) 'No one knows how it works' It so happens Lucas has Pompe disease. The ventilator and wheelchair he depends on are part of the picture, not the definition of it, although it has informed his work in unique musical ways. Growing up, Lucas says, "Like any kid, I was all over the place, into something new every day. Then, I heard my dad playing the White Album by the Beatles when I was really little, about 7, and I was like, What the hell am I hearing? I was instantly into it." Lucas studied guitar briefly as a kid with local Mike Flores, but says he is largely self-taught. He's recently begun additional lessons with acoustic blues player Thomasina Winslow of Albany. Reaching Through Dreams has a sound reminiscent of 70s concept artists Peter Gabriel or David Byrne. Lucas' unique baritone voice has an ethereal quality, high on the outside edge. His songs are both complex and catchy. "I never took vocal lessons," Lucas says, "but I sing practically every day." "Absolutely no one including myself knows how the hell I'm singing on a ventilator," he says. "Even my doctor asks, how do you do it? "The long answer is, I breathe with the ventilator in a way that incorporates the muscles." He's in a wheelchair, but he's not paralyzed, Lucas notes. "The only difference between me and a typical person is, my muscles don't work as well. But they do work." "When I was young, I was a lot weaker than I am now. When people say, they've never seen anyone play the guitar quite like I do," he says, "I had to learn a lot of different patterns. I didn't have the strength to go up and down the neck. In that sense, my weakness at the time informed my playing. "Now I'm older, stronger and healthier. I can play the way the guitar is usually played." The modifications he developed are "not unprecedented," Lucas says, but more common to jazz players. He calls his guitar style "the best of both: Conventionality, and some unconventionalness." "Even though I have a math and science background," and opportunity to pursue a related career, he says, "I know what I need to be doing. It just feels right to be doing music. At the end of the day you have to do the career that is meaningful to you." Today, he says, "All the income I make is from music making or music activities," including teaching guitar and writing about music for Nippertown, the online Capital Region music site. 'Music is an equalizer' "Music is an equalizer," Lucas says. "People see me with a guitar in my hand, they take me a lot more seriously than they do if they just see me out and about." That's both fortunate and unfortunate, he says. "Stereotypes are lazy. Speaking just from my experience," he says he sees less "ableism" from younger people than older — maybe a sign the world is changing. And, he says, "When it comes to music, I see the least ableism. They don't care what your problem is. They just want to make some music. There are lots of other messed up things in the music industry, but looking at me as an equal, it's nice to have that." "I don't like to pigeonhole myself," Lucas says of his sound. "Overall, I call it alternative rock. It's broad, allows me to do whatever I want." Influences, Beatles to locals "Influences," he says: "I started with the Beatles. Cat Stevens, Jethro Tull, Peter Gabriel, Jack White of the White Stripes. I listen to a lot of different things, all the way back to 1500s Celtic music." He appreciates local musicians he's worked with citing, among others, Girl Blue and Candy Ambulance — longtime collaborators he played with earlier this fall at the Park Theater in Glens Falls. "I'm thankful to be part of a great community of musicians," he says. "Now to be playing Caffe Lena as a headliner…." His Lucas Garrett Band members are Kevin Kosach on bass, Madison Lewis on vocals, and rotating drummers — Sam Zucchini for the Lena gig. The local who's-who of album collaborators includes Eric Braymer on bass, Paul Guay on drums, Tania Susi on violin, Jonathan Newell on keys, the late Bob Bates on cello, and producers Marc Clayton and Alan Dunham. Pandemic-born album 'Reaching' Reaching Through Dreams had its start in August 2020, "when the pandemic was at its worst," Lucas says. "I thought I was done with music. We had so much going and then, like so many of my friends, lost it all overnight. I was a guitar teacher, performing out and working at various studios. I had all this money coming in, and it all went away overnight. I sat down and wrote the first song, 'So Many Times.' It's really a story about anxiety." He put it aside, he said, until 2021. "As the world started opening, slowly, I found it again." "At the same time someone came into my life that changed how I view love. I'm not old, but when you are 29 and someone changes your entire view on what love is — a lot of songs on the album deal with that as well," he says. "The first lyric on the album is 'I'm going crazy, what is under my bed?' The last lyric of the last song is 'You lay your head on my shoulder of stone, it turns into clouds.'

Vance class sets record with 8 female pilots VANCE AIR FORCE BASE, Okla. — Vance Air Force Base set a new record Dec. 3 as eight of the student pilots graduating in Class 22-03 were women. That broke the previous record of seven women graduating with Class 17-06 in March 2017. The eight women and 22 men in Class 22-03 embraced their diversity by celebrating women throughout their entire time training in the T-6A Texan II. In fact, their class patch, an identifier worn by all members of the class, embraced female pop culture. "We're the 'girl class,'" said 2nd Lt. Caitlin Bitting, now in follow-on training with the 25th Flying Training Squadron at Vance. "So we made our class patch based off of the movie 'Mean Girls' to tell people to 'get in… we're going flying.'" 2nd Lt. Raily Duffy, with Class 22-03, is the creative genius behind the iconic patch. "The guys ate it up, they even got mad when we tried to use the color yellow instead of pink," Duffy said. While Class 22-03 was a record-breaking class, members of the class described the experience as normal. "When I walked in and saw that many girls, I didn't think anything of it," said 2nd Lt. Shinryu Aoyama, a male student pilot in the class. "I mean, we like to brag when we're different, and being different isn't a weakness, it's a strength that we got to share as a class. With different ways of thinking and different backgrounds, it can only make us better." The mission at Vance continues to be to train the world's best pilots. Class 22-03 members made sure that even with a record-breaking class, they brought just as much to the table as every other class. "Being in this profession, it's important to know that standards don't change based on gender," said 1st Lt. Kaitlyn Cook, a student now in follow-on training with the 25th FTS. In addition to the patch, the women brought a since of camaraderie that the other classes didn't seem to have. They looked at pilot training as a "team sport." "Our flight commander emphasized that if we worked together, we would succeed," Cook said. "We really took that to heart, even to go as far as to have weekly dinners and breakfasts together." Duffy also thought the brunches their class enjoyed were a unique twist that the women brought. Whether it was the brunches or the teamwork, Cook and Duffy's recipe for success paid off. They both graduated as two of the three distinguished graduates from Class 22-03. "I would tell young girls that want to fly, to go for it," Cook said. "It's hard for a reason. We need our Air Force pilots to know how to do complex things. Don't let that deter you from being a part of such an awesome group." The other five females graduating with Class 22-03 were 2nd Lt. Abby deVarennes, 2nd Lt. Mary Luking, 2nd Lt. Melanie Sundahl, 2nd Lt. Mariah Waters and 2nd Lt. Kayla Wofford. Article by: 2nd Lt. Alyssa Letts 71st Training Wing Public Affairs

METAIRIE, La. (AP) — The New Orleans Saints have placed P.J. Williams on injured reserve, three days after the cornerback absorbed a hard hit to the head during Sunday's loss to the New York Giants. Williams, whose designation was posted on the NFL's transactions listings Wednesday, took a knee to the helmet in a collision with Giants tight end Larry Donnell. Williams was able to move his extremities, but was immobilized, carted off the field and taken to a hospital. On Monday, Saints coach Sean Payton said Williams had a concussion, but otherwise called the cornerback's prognosis "real encouraging." Williams, a 2015 third-round draft choice, spent his entire rookie season on injured reserve with a hamstring injury. Now his second season has ended after two games. The Saints have added offensive tackle Tony Hills to their active roster.

Lifestyle / Entertainment Kim Kardashian West meets with death row inmate by The Sunday Post © Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Kim Kardashian West has described the moment a death row inmate, whose case she has championed, received a stay of execution. Kardashian West, a reality TV star who is studying for a career in law, believes there is "substantial evidence" that would exonerate murder accused Rodney Reed. Reed, 51, was facing death by lethal injection on Wednesday for the 1996 killing of a 19-year-old woman. Following a high-profile campaign featuring celebrities including Beyonce and Oprah Winfrey to have his case reexamined, Texas's top criminal appeals court halted the execution. Kardashian West revealed she was with Reed when the decision was announced and described the moment he discovered the news. She tweeted: "Today, I had the honour of meeting #RodneyReed in person and the privilege of sitting with him when he got the news that the highest court in Texas had issued a stay of execution and remanded the case back to the trial court for further consideration. "Words cannot describe the relief and hope that swept over the room in that moment. "We have seen Democrats and Republicans come together. We have seen grassroots activists and lawmakers link arms."

Since the beginning of 2012, for one of our clients with a big news website, we recognized a drastic increase in website traffic without an accompanying increase in ad impressions. Under normal conditions, an increase in traffic would be a positive sign; however, in this case it was caused by end user software that turned normal web users into aggressive web crawlers. This essentially created an accidental but consistent distributed DoS (denial of service) attack. Here, we explain how we identified the cause and mitigated its effects. This is strange because Firefox 3.0.10 is a very old (more or less extinct) browser version. Looking closer at the traffic patterns, we came to the conclusion that the traffic was not coming from real website visitors but from a web crawler. We shared our findings on serverfault.com and found a few other website owners having exactly the same strange traffic patterns on their websites. The source IP addresses were distributed around the world. Tracing back the IP addresses mainly revealed Internet end users, which is uncommon for a normal web crawler. At that point, we were not able to identify the root cause, so we decided to block all requests coming from that specific user agent string. The following graph shows the traffic for one day in May 2012. There were over 20 Million page views with a peak of over 2000 requests per second. For that day you can see that the majority (~82%) of page requests got blocked because they used that specific user agent string. The following graphs shows how blocking the crawler became less effective. Luckily, this unique user agent string also pointed us to the root cause: Genieo. Genieo provides a software product for Windows and Mac computers. In short, it builds a personalized homepage containing recent news headlines. When installed, it runs in the background and constantly browses the Internet for news that you might be interested in. Basically, it runs a web crawler on your computer that connects to news websites directly. You can use the "systray" icon to stop the background browsing / crawling. Currently, the web traffic caused by Genieo is very high because every single computer that has the Genieo software installed is busy crawling the Internet at a high rate. The Genieo product looks interesting and could potentially drive some real visitors to news websites. It is also obviously a useful product to have developed a user base. However, the rate of crawling and the resulting extra bandwidth costs forced us to make the unfortunate decision to block Genieo again. We contacted Genieo and they told us that a recent updated did reduce the amount of web traffic caused by their software. They are aware of the issue, and have planned future improvements that will reduce the amount even more. We can already confirm that traffic from Genieo has dropped. We shared our results with Genieo and they have promised to fix the user agent string soon. We'll update this blog post as soon as Genieo has implemented changes.

Danny DeVito Buys 'Taxi' Reprieve With 'SNL' Stunt If television executives have learned one thing (and it's far from certain that they have) it's not to piss off Danny DeVito. The TV veteran has never been afraid of biting the hands that have gingerly fed him during his time on such classic series as It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia or Taxi. The diminutive but garrulous DeVito has made a career out of playing irascible, irresponsible loudmouths, mirroring the acclaimed actor and director's willingness to take a snarky stand for something he believes in. Just ask ABC, which found itself in the crosshairs of DeVito on his Season 7 hosting stint on Saturday Night Live. DeVito, then famous for playing unscrupulous taxi dispatcher Louie DePalma on ABC's Taxi, had been booked to host the May 15, 1982, episode of SNL, which just so happened to fall 11 days after Taxi creator and fellow TV legend James L. Brooks was told by Anthony D. Thomopoulos, president of ABC Entertainment, that the ratings-challenged Taxi's just-concluded fourth season would be its last. DeVito asked SNL producer Dick Ebersol if he could use his monologue to do a little Louie-esque venting. Ebersol, to his credit, not only allowed that but went a few steps further in skewering rival ABC for canceling one of the best and most intelligent sitcoms in TV history — including airing one filmed sketch so literally explosive that it's been edited out of the Peacock version of the episode available now. Watch Danny DeVito in a 1982 Episode of 'Saturday Night Live' Kicking off his monologue, DeVito gets a shower of boos by announcing Taxi's cancellation, putting a biting emphasis on the network that had done the deed. "That's the American Broadcasting Company," DeVito stressed to a new wave of sympathetic New York hostility. "A … B … C." DeVito then produced a letter he claimed had been written to him by his Italian immigrant mother, reading, in part, "You have been besmirched by men so shallow that they do not know the depths to which their deeds have taken them," with Mrs. DeVito purportedly concluding, "May God forgive them, but of course, we understand if He does not." But DeVito had an even bigger surprise for the SNL audience, as, lamenting the fact that the cast and crew were robbed of a proper "final bow" when filming what turned out to be their last episode, DeVito welcomed all of his Taxi costars alongside him in Studio 8H. One by one, DeVito brought out Andy Kaufman, Christopher Lloyd, Marilu Henner, Tony Danza and Judd Hirsch to rapturous applause and a standing ovation from the crowd. (Longtime regular Jeff Conaway was not in attendance, having been let go from the show in response to the substance-abuse issues that would plague him until he died in 2011.) Frequent Saturday Night Live provocateur Kaufman, it should be noted, sports the neck brace he wore following his recent worked-shoot wrestling match against Jerry "The King" Lawler, an infamous stunt played up throughout the night's episode. It's playful (Hirsch sweeps DeVito into an embrace at the end), with just the right edge of "screw-you" to ABC. But that was nothing compared to the first sketch following the monologue, a filmed piece set to Taxi's melancholy instrumental theme song ("Angela" by Bob James), which sees DeVito's DePalma riding a cab to the ABC building — and blowing it up via remote detonator. A joke about somebody destroying a very real New York City skyscraper doesn't play in a post-9/11 TV landscape, so the 51-minute Peacock version of DeVito's episode omits the sketch. (Two performances by the band Sparks were also cut, because of music-licensing issues.) Still, with DeVito striking a victory pose at the sound of ABC's headquarters crumbling to dust, the destruction at least seems in line with Louie DePalma's MO. ABC still had one more blow coming its way: During the goodnights, DePalma brings out his actual mother, Julia. An Italian immigrant, Mrs. DeVito, shorter even than Danny and defiantly smoking a cigarette, is asked if she has another message for the people who put her son out of a job. Indeed she does, as Mrs. DeVito spits out a series of Italian curses (the words "ciucca" and "stupida" are in there for sure), while the mixed and assembled Taxi and Saturday Night Live cast members cheer in delight. Fellow Italian Danza even puts his hand over his mouth in shock before leaning in for a kiss. Watch a 1982 Promo for Danny DeVito's 'Saturday Night Live' Appearance Little did ABC know that its public humiliation was just beginning. Following DeVito's episode, NBC would pick up Taxi for its fifth and final season in 1983. Even then, however, the blue-collar cabbies of the Sunshine Cab Company couldn't catch a break. While the fifth-season order did put the series over the 100-episode mark that was then necessary for the show to be sold to syndication, NBC, too, canceled the series at the end of that season. Perhaps taking a cue from DeVito's gleefully spiteful example, Hirsch, after winning his second Emmy as Taxi's longest-suffering driver Alex Reiger, mocked NBC president Grant Tinker who was sitting in the Emmy audience. (In addition to Hirsch, Taxi costars Lloyd and Carole Kane also took home Emmys on the night.) "We're ready, Grant, we're ready, whenever you want to put us back on," taunted Hirsch, proving, as DeVito did before him, you don't cross even a fictional New York cabbie, and then give him a live mic.

Georgia May Jagger Signs With CAA Fashion The Hollywood agency's fashion division has also signed Marquita Pring, the Dominican-American model and activist. By Booth Moore on January 12, 2021 Georgia May Jagger on the cover of Elle. Courtesy/Russell James CAA Fashion is continuing to expand in 2021. The Hollywood agency's burgeoning fashion division has signed Georgia May Jagger, daughter of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger and model Jerry Hall. Known for her signature Jagger pout and gap teeth, she has appeared on the covers of Vogue, Elle and Harper's Bazaar, and appeared in campaigns for Chanel, Versace and Miu Miu. Jagger has been the face of the Just Cavalli and Angel by Thierry Mugler fragrances, and is the muse for the jewelry company Pandora. She's managed by Tess Management in London. CAA has also signed Marquita Pring, the Dominican-American model and activist who made waves in 2010 when she appeared in the "Curves Ahead" V Magazine spread, one of the first size-inclusive fashion editorials. Later that year, Pring walked the Jean Paul Gaultier spring 2011 runway in Paris, and in 2012, she covered Italian Vogue, a milestone for curvy women in the fashion industry. Pring has appeared in ads for Levi Strauss & Co., Polo Ralph Lauren, Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Lane Bryant, Marks & Spencer, Talbots, L'Oréal and Olay; in magazines including Vogue, Glamour and Cosmopolitan, and on the runways for Christian Siriano, Tommy Hilfiger, Tadashi Shoji and Prabal Gurung.

I was making this bag for a sandwich lunch I made for my husband to take to work on a special occasion (he usually just carries a regular lunch bag because I'm not making this for every single lunch! Are you kidding me…). It's really simple to make .. I'm not one for elaborate projects that mere mortals like myself can only drool on. Cut 2 rectangle piece of patterned paper approx. larger than the front and center die, stitch a panel of cardstock down the middle and die cut both panels (this will make the front and the bag of the bag). Adhere a ribbon down the front center panel. Trim a lunch bag down to size and adhere the stitched panel to the front and bag of lunch bag. Make a bow from the same ribbon and add tag and bow to the bag. Embellish with a button. There you have it … and there are so many cute images on the set that I'm planning to use the muffin image for my son's school lunch next. Here is the cutest kitchen set I've laid my eyes on. I hope your New Year has been going well. For me, most of the hustle and bustle of the holiday season and the clean up after that is done and some sense of normalcy and routine is coming back to our lives. Just at a right time for me, Crafter's Companion has just released a new collection of Kanji stamps – lots of unique and meaningful Asian sentiment and images. This collection intimidated me at first – I didn't recognize any of those Asian characters and I have never done any Asian art – even if I am Asian! But as I was working through my supplies looking for Asian embellishments and papers to use (I have few of those too), my creative juices started perculating. I found in my supplies some mulberry papers, flowers and leaves looking like Cherry Blossoms and willow, bamboo skewers and chopsticks (those were extras from some takeout I ate at my desk), Asian images on Western papers like a trendy fusion mix (this I found in Basic Grey and Kaiser Craft paper collections), I even though of stamping these Asian characters as my background paper! The unexpected can surprise you. I hope you will have as much fun with this set as I did. Here's wishing you tranquility for the New Year ahead. I just noticed that I have been posting quite a bit the last couple of weeks. Well well, that's because I have been in crafty heaven these days with the huge box of goodies Stampendous sent me that I totally forgot about one of my closest friend's birthday. Tsk tsk – what a terrible friend I am and I'm very ashamed to admit this. But the crafter in me yearns to share the card I made for her – she loves these pretty girly things in pastel colors so I hope she likes all the scalloped edges, the twirly whirlies, the sparkle and soft colors I included in her card. And I also hope she forgives me too. I played with alot of Stampendous products on this card. First of all, I created the colorful background with Distressed Ink (Fired Brick, Wild Honey, Tumbled Glass) and a stippling brush. Scalloped punch top edge and round bottom edge. Then I stamp the flourish from the Stampendous Cling Jumbo Dahlia stamp set with Distressed Ink (Pumice Stone). I randomly emboss the colored background with Frantage Embossing Enamel (Shabby White), Stampendous Vintage Glitter (multi crystal mix) and Frantage mica fragments (Pearlized Mica). The finished background was adhere to card base and top edge stitch twice. American Craft Ribbon was attached. The sentiment I used is from the Stampendous Birthday Assortment Perfectly Clear Stamps and stamped on vellum and diecut with PTI doily die. Finish card by attaching sentiment and Kaiser Craft flower blossom. I used The Pixie Cottage stamp "To You from Us" from Michelle's Scrapbooking and More. They are just too adorable these 2 little kittens. DP is from Authentique Papers. Flowers are from Kaiser Craft. So now it's your turn to go and create and come back and share with us. The randomly picked winner of their choice of two fabulous Pixie Cottage stamps. By now, you would have figured out that I am a huge fan of Crissy Armstrong's images – they are so achingly adorable, I think. I am extremely proud to be guest designing for her today. Her challenge this month is "anything goes" – make any card you like and go to her challenge blog, Sundays with Crissy, to play along. Ain't Rupert the cutest – I left the card without a sentiment so I could use it for any occasion as it crops up. DP is from Basic Grey (green) and I apologize I cannot remember the manufacturer of the yellow dot paper (it's from my stash). The butterfly pin is from Jillibean Soup – I have the hardest time finding hat pins so if you know of a place to get them, let me know. This little cutie (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch) is one of Crissy's newer releases … even the name is cute. I love that she has these pencil drawing too – make the whole images so much softer. DP is from October Afternoon (black menu) and Lily Bee Designs (yellow dots). Ribbon is from Fancy Pants Designs. Flower is from Kaiser Craft. There is your dose of cuteness for the day. All of these Crissy's images that I have used can be found at Whimsy Stamps. Have a fun kind of day!
If you only had four things in your fridge, what could you cook? Of course, it would depend on the four things. But after a while it would get pretty boring. Suppose you only had four DVD's. If you were stuck on an island, which four DVD's would you bring? Any way you slice it, whatever "category" you put those four things in, the answer would always be very limited. Four cities to live in and travel to. Four kinds of food. (That would at least give you some variety). Cytosine, guanine, adenine and thymine. These are the four nucleotides. Only these four make up EVERYTHING about you. The difference is precisely HOW they are arranged. Put them in one order, and you're dead before you've got a chance. Put them in another order, and you have super human skills of X-men proportions. Nobody knows WHEN or IF we'll be able understand what order matches what trait. Or even if there's more going on than we can measure. After all, take two similar people and they can create VASTLY different things. These DNA nucleotides create the structure of your brain. But who or what creates the thoughts that you think? Most people are content to think thoughts that others think. Some people think different thoughts, but they still do the same things. The precious few who make a huge difference are those who THINK differently as well as ACT differently. Because without actions, thoughts are just a hobby. But how do you KNOW what to think? How do you know HOW to think? You can make them up as you go along. Keep trying different "thoughts" in different orders, until you hit on a winning combination that will forever change your life, and the world around you.

Q: Drupal6: In theme_preprocess_page(&$vars), where do $vars come from? (How to manipulate breadcrumb) I want to remove the breadcrumb when it's just one entry ("Home"). I'm in my theme's theme_preprocess_page(&$vars) function. $vars['breadcrumb'] is available, but it's just HTML. This is a bit to clumsy to work with. I'd rather get it as an array of items in the breadcrumb list, and do something like this: if (count($breadcrumb) == 1) { unset($breadcrumb); } Where does $vars come from? How can I override the code creating it originally? A: A $vars array is passed on between all preprocess functions. In case of the _preprocess_page functions, most of the values in $vars are created in template_preprocess_page (see http://api.drupal.org/api/function/template_preprocess_page/6). In that function, you'll see: $variables['breadcrumb'] = theme('breadcrumb', drupal_get_breadcrumb()); Here, drupal_get_breacrumb returns an array of breadcrumb elements, which is then themed by the theme_breadcrumb() function (or its override). The easiest way to get what you want is to override the theme_breadcrumb function. To do that, you take the original theme_breadcrumb function (http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_breadcrumb/6), copy it to your template.php, replace 'theme' in the function name with the name of your theme and alter the code so it looks like this: function THEMENAME_breadcrumb($breadcrumb) { if (count($breadcrumb) > 1) { // This was: if (!empty($breadcrumb)) return '<div class="breadcrumb">'. implode(' » ', $breadcrumb) .'</div>'; } } For a better understanding of Drupal theme overrides and preprocess functions, see About overriding themable output and Setting up variables for use in a template (preprocess functions).
Michigan State tops rival Michigan for Big Ten Tournament title Dylan Buell / Getty Images Sport / Getty CHICAGO (AP) Matt McQuaid scored a career-high 27 points, Cassius Winston converted the go-ahead layup in the closing minute, and No. 6 Michigan State rallied to beat No. 10 Michigan 65-60 for its sixth Big Ten Tournament championship on Sunday. The top-seeded Spartans (28-6) rallied from a 13-point deficit in the second half and scored the game's final 10 points to capture their first championship since 2016. No other program has won the tournament as many times as Michigan State, and this one was particularly sweet. After all, the Spartans prevented a championship three-peat by Michigan (28-6) and beat their rivals for the third time this season. McQuaid nailed a personal-best seven 3-pointers. Winston, the Big Ten Player of the Year, had 14 points and 11 assists as Michigan State won for the 10th time in 11 games. The Spartans were awarded a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament and will face Bradley in the second round on Thursday in Des Moines, Iowa. Ignas Brazdeikas led Michigan with 19 points. Jordan Poole scored 13. Jon Teske had 10 points and 10 rebounds. Zavier Simpson added 10 assists. But the third-seeded Wolverines fell again to Michigan State after blowing their chance to win the league by losing to their rivals twice in the final four regular-season games. Michigan led by 13 early in the second half, but Michigan State went on a 13-4 run to tie it at 48 with just over seven minutes remaining. The Wolverines were up 60-55 after Livers hit a 3 with 2:29 left. But McQuaid answered with one of his own to start the game-ending run and Xavier Tillman made a tying layup for Michigan State. After Simpson missed a 3 for Michigan, Winston drove to his left for a layup to put the Spartans on top 62-60 with 28 seconds left. Brazdeikas then missed a pull-up jumper that got tipped by Aaron Henry with 14 seconds to play. Teske and Tillman went up for the rebound, the ball got tipped out of bounds and the referees gave possession to Michigan State after a review as Michigan coach John Beilein screamed on the sideline. Henry made a free throw and missed hit the second, making it a three-point game. Poole then appeared to get bumped by Winston - Michigan State had a foul to give - as he launched a long 3 off the dribble, but there was no call. The Spartans' Kenny Goins hit two free throws to make it 65-60 with two seconds left. Michigan State forward Kyle Ahrens was taken from the court on a stretcher with a left leg injury in the first half. Michigan: The Wolverines have their sights set on another big NCAA run after losing to Villanova in the championship game last year. Michigan State: The Spartans head to the tournament with high hopes, though their rotation figures to be a little thinner after Ahrens went down. Michigan: NCAA Tournament.

She's been facing bullies her whole damn career. Hillary Clinton knows how to handle boy bullies and all the sexist mess they bring to the table. So expect her to keep her chill on Monday night, when she faces off with Donald Trump, the most blatant misogynist to ever grace the presidential debate stage. The gender dynamics going into this first widely anticipated debate are so loaded and unsubtle, it's almost comical. But, essentially, Clinton's been prepping for this moment for the entirety of her career ― from at least the time she had to face down hostile comments when she was taking the bar exam to some infamously charged moments in debates during her Senate run in 2000 and her failed presidential bid in 2008. Like any woman who's spent her entire career navigating through male-dominated corridors, Clinton's become fairly adept at turning blatant and subtle sexism to her advantage. In a 2008 debate with Barack Obama ahead of the New Hampshire primaries, Clinton was asked to comment on why voters liked her opponent more than her. Clinton smiled. "Well, that hurts my feelings," she said. "But I'll go on." Her eyes reflected only amusement. When a few seconds later Obama went on to interrupt her and say "you're likable enough Hillary," she did a kind of cute little chair dance. But he comes off as more than a little patronizing and the moment is considered one of Obama's stumbles during that campaign. The moment also likely helped to propel Clinton to win the New Hampshire primary. The "likability" issue is at this point widely acknowledged to be a question no male candidate would face. Did anyone question John McCain's personality in 2008? Did anyone ask about Trump's likability in the 2016 GOP primaries? Deflecting or calling out sexist treatment is Clinton's special talent in debates, a provocative piece argues on Quartz. Instead of shrinking away from sexism, she's tended to respond in a highly sympathetic and, yes, likable way. There's the now legendary moment in her 2000 run for the Senate, (around 1 minute into the above video) when her opponent, Congressman Rick Lazio, made the mistake of crossing the debate stage, urging Clinton to sign a pledge on soft money and even wagging his finger at her. Played endlessly afterward, Lazio was portrayed as a sexist bully, as this piece in Mother Jones notes. Lazio now says that the moment doomed him. He lost to Clinton by a wide margin. I don't think it's so obvious to these guys ― remember they play almost constantly with other men. Politics in the U.S. is a boys club. Men occupy more than 80 percent of the seats in Congress. Men hold the majority of governorships. There's never been a woman president. Clinton is one of only 46 women to have been a senator since the founding of the U.S. Male politicians simply aren't very practiced when it comes to working with women. Clinton on the other hand has spent essentially her entire life navigating male spheres. Her decision to not change her name from Rodham to Clinton is considered a major factor in her husband losing his bid for governor of Arkansas in 1980. Bill Clinton's opponent Frank White made pointed references to his wife, Mrs. Frank White, throughout the race, as Lisa Lerer writes for the AP. Two years later, when her husband ran for office again, Hillary changed her last name. She's been beat up in a host of other gendered ways since then ― for daring to work and raise a kid, for possibly disparaging cookie making, for her husband's infidelity. And even, for not looking presidential. If you go back and look at interviews with Clinton, she is asked questions that no man would have to stomach. Of course, we can't predict with any certainty that Clinton will best Trump on Monday night. He's a total wild card. And though he lacks political experience, he knows his way around the TV screen. Besides, sexism isn't the only play the reality TV star has up his sleeve. Clinton is vulnerable on other issues, of course. She hasn't always handled questions about, say, her email so gracefully. But when it comes to the sexist tropes Trump likes to trade in ― calling women fat pigs, or breastfeeding disgusting, or saying they're better off at home ― Trump isn't actually offering up anything new to Clinton. He's perhaps the purest distillation of decades of piling on. Clinton's gender radar is a finely honed instrument ― and her mettle has been repeatedly tested. So it's no surprise she's got a track record of turning insults and casual, unconscious sexism to her advantage. If she wasn't able to do that ― she'd be at home in Chappaqua baking cookies.

The Energeia Museum opened on the premises of the power station in 1986. In this museum one could see preserved steam engines and steam turbines, along with many documents and books from 1900-1960. The museum was completely open to the public and very popular in its early years. In 1990 there were talks between the three Belgian suppliers, from which a large merger between Ebes, Intercom and Unerg arose. Electrabel was born. While Intercom and Ebes were fully integrated into the new company, Unerg maintained a few more plants in its own name. It later changed its name to Powerfin, in order to continue expanding its activities abroad. After changes in the agreements on public relations, the management of Electrabel decided in 2000 to close the Museum Energeia. In 2001, no less than 180 running meters (or 3584 records) were moved to archives to ensure safe storage. But the end of the electricity production in Langerbrugge, apparently got a painful outcome when in 2012 the demolition of the plant started. The older buildings were completely destroyed, including all installations and the more modern buildings are currently being dismantled. Nothing of its historical value was retained. Despite the fact that a large part of the archive in the Energeia museum had already been moved to another location, a whole bunch of paperwork and machines remained behind. Unfortunately, (copper) thieves already got their chance to strike their battle, so that all exhibited machines, including a 1912 compound steam engine that was previously in perfect condition, had been destroyed on their search for copper and other useful materials. The Brown Boveri turbines were completely disassembled and copper was removed. Measuring equipment and control panels were stolen. Almost all museum pieces, including a whole section classified as monument – transformers, control switches, alternators – have been completely destroyed. The remaining documents from the former Ebes archive from 1900-1960 were destroyed.
Copyright batte over 'unauthorized' Catcher in the Rye commentary Jim Lindgren has an interesting post over at Volokh.com concerning the legal battle over a book that may or may not be characterized by some as an unauthorized sequel to "Catcher in the Rye". Be sure to read it here. This case brings up a number of issues: First, it exposes the lie that is perpetuated in the legal community that copyright laws don't protect "ideas", but rather only the "concrete expression" of ideas. In practicality, this statement is pure nonsense as evidenced by the fact that a copyrighted work seals in monopoly protections of "characters" and "derivative works" - even if such derivative works don't include any actual "copying" of cloned material from the underlying work. For instance, if I feel that I have a far better script or storyline that utilizes the character of James Bond, but without utilizing any previous cloned image from a Bond film and without copying previously used dialogue beyond a minimal instance of "My name is Bond...James Bond." or "Shaken...not stirred.", I still would not be able to create it, because Ian Flemming's estate and/or Sony Pictures, etc. has a monopoly over the IDEA of James Bond. I would argue that by protecting "derivative" works, copyright effectively asserts control over ideas - except for those envisioned at the most abstract levels. Second, this case also illustrates just how slippery (and I would argue, unsustainable) current fair use concepts are that try to differentiate between "criticism", "parody" and academic explorations of previous literary works versus competing concepts such as "satire" and unauthorized "derivative works" that may contain some vestiges of the previously mentioned fair use categories. How will "Coming Through The Rye" be classified if it functions as both a "derivative work" of "Catcher in the Rye" as well as literary criticism and history concerning the creation of the same? Third, this case seems to be another instance of where the judiciary throws out their usual rules regarding prior restraints against free speech when it comes to mere (unproven) allegations of IP infringement. Courts will not allow prior restraints in libel cases. They didn't even allow it in the famed Pentagon Papers case which involved allegations of breaches of national security. But when it comes to protecting IP whenever somebody shouts "copyright" - judges too often seem to ignore free speech concerns. Eugene Volokh wrote a great law paper on this issue. I'd advise checking it out here: http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/copyinj.htm I remember once being lucky enough to come across a copy of "The Wind Done Gone" during a time when a federal judge had enjoined its publication through a temporary restraining order - essentially declaring it unlawful to own and distribute due to copyright complaints from the Margaret Mitchell estate. I purchased it, and secretly horded it away as though I was living through some twisted version of "Fahrenheit 451". I thought it might remain on the list of "banned books" in the U.S. As it turned out however, the copyright case over it was settled, and the book was eventually "allowed" to published. Perhaps the proper solution is the same one utilized in "Fahrenheit 451". When a rebellious populous was faced with a nation of "firemen" whose job it was to burn all books, each person was given the task of committing a book to memory in order to orally recite it later to others, thus circumventing the state by placing the books in the one area it could not reach - the human mind.

CrowdOptic's patented technology (U.S. Patent No. 8,527,340) offers a revolutionary way of determining what people are looking at and what they find interesting. It works in real time by collecting sensor data from mobile devices and using that data to construct the device user's line of sight. When the user's line of sigh intersects with another user's line of sight that intersection is noted by the system. Clusters of sight line intersections are then computed to determine where the crowd is looking. At the heart of the system is the per second update. This is a mechanism where the device reports the needed sensor data to CrowdOptic and in return CrowdOptic sends cluster data. Additionally users can interact with clusters by attaching comments, tags, photos and videos that will travel with the cluster. To start using CrowdOptic you must first obtain a partner ID and an API key from CrowdOptic. To obtain your ID and key please please fill out this form. Once you have your partner package, you may also utilize our data visualization tool Live Map. It will show you in real time where users are aiming their devices, where clusters are being formed, and the media that associated with them. To use live map log in with the email and password that were given to you by CrowdOptic and a link will appear in the top menu.

The Next Step for UAE/China Following President Xi's visit to the UAE last week, the two countries have an opportunity to leverage their shared interests in emerging technologies By Xische Editorial, July 25, 2018 Source: Vectorpouch/Shutterstock President Xi arrived in Abu Dhabi last Thursday for a state visit—the first by a Chinese head of state in almost 30 years—designed to reinforce the already hefty economic and cultural ties between China and the UAE. However, his visit may have missed a broader opportunity to leverage the two countries' shared interest in emerging technologies—namely artificial intelligence, blockchain, and ICT infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, energy investment and the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) featured heavily during President Xi's three-day trip. The flurry of announcements included a partnership and investment agreement in the world's largest solar energy project, two memorandums of understanding to enhance e-commerce ties and greater cooperation at the China International Import Expo, and several extensive energy agreements. The UAE stands to profit from translating China's ever-expanding trade interests in the region to those grounded in emerging technology. Indeed, the two countries already have a strong track record of collaboration on technology initiatives, including the YVOLV data centre, a project by Meeras and Alibaba, along with the MBR Solar Park, which is run by DEWA and the Silk Road Fund. Pairing Chinese talent with UAE test environments would support the development of everything from AI technology and blockchain to telecoms in both countries and accelerate global development. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai lit up in the colours of the Chinese flag to mark President Xi's visit last week. Source: The National (CC) AI systems are heavily dependent on data. China's ability to harness the large volume of data emanating from its billion-plus citizens is one of its natural advantages in the field. The BRI's trade networks across the emerging world present a valuable data proposition for China. Not only can Beijing expand its influence through the creation of analogue infrastructure such as bridges, tunnels, and railroads, but the country can also expand its technology footprint. China is betting big on becoming a leader in high tech innovation. In July 2017, China announced a development plan to become the global leader in artificial intelligence, including a $2.1bn technology park in Beijing dedicated to AI research. With homegrown mega-companies such as Baidu and Tencent already leading the global AI race, China is well-positioned to achieve this goal. The UAE is a slightly different case. While the UAE announced its strategy for AI in October 2017, coupled with investment in AI projected to surpass $8bn by the end of 2017, the country is still in the process of developing or recruiting the right talent to deliver on the UAE's AI goals. By leveraging Chinese technological expertise, the UAE can rapidly grow its AI expertise. Meanwhile, the Chinese will benefit from the optimal testing ground for AI solutions that the UAE provides with access to high-quality engagement points of over 200 nationalities that call the UAE home. On ICT infrastructure, particularly high-speed and broadband internet, the UAE could - and should - step in. China has been successful in selling smartphones outside of the mainland with companies such as Transsion and Huawei dominating smartphone sales across African and Asian markets. Meanwhile, through telecoms companies such as Etisalat, the UAE has experience in several markets along the BRI. The conditions are ripe for a UAE-China partnership on blockchain development, an area that certainly warrants further investigation. The UAE has an established track record on blockchain with the Dubai government taking the lead and pushing for blockchain to be used in the public sector. Likewise, China has expressed interest in using blockchain to improve governance. Working together with Chinese researchers and companies, the UAE could build on its alliance with China to expand blockchain research around the world. As Xische's strategy advisor, Mary Ames, recently argued in Gulf News, "Analysts predict that Chinese officials are setting the stage for a new blockchain strategy. If so, then China will soon join the UAE in shifting all applicable government transactions to local and federal blockchains. Given China's influence on the blockchain industry, such a move is likely to have a profound impact on the trajectory of the evolving technology." Technological innovation requires the ability to quickly draw on the best talent from across the globe. The UAE has an opportunity to translate its strategic relationship with China on the BRI to an important partnership on emerging technologies like AI, blockchain, and ICT infrastructure. President Xi's visit to the UAE is proof positive that both countries have much to gain from such a strategic bilateral relationship. Now is the time to take it to the next level.

2022 Mazda RX 7 Changes, Interior, HP Posted on April 23, 2022 by Al Connie R. Mitchell 2022 Mazda RX 7 Changes, Interior, HP – Mazda did not state once the generation automobile will get to showrooms. Still, it appears that the subsequent-gen RX-7's progress is determined by how fast the technical engineers can think of a dependable and energy-successful Wankel powerplant. More information ought to grow to be offered in 2016. However, right up until you're doing, we made an offering in the manufacturing automobile, together with a thoughtful inspection regarding what the subsequent-gen RX-7 may well provide the kitchen table. 2022 Mazda RX 7 Changes 2022 Mazda RX 7 Engine 2022 Mazda RX 7 Price and Release Date Just like most concept cars, the RX-Sight goes via some adjustments before it will become a generation automobile. Our supplying depicts a somewhat well developed directly down variation in the Tokyo examine, provided with various creation-pleasant capabilities. Our designer started away by supplying the RX-Eyesight a higher roof structure. While the idea is hostile having its very low roofline, the function isn't likely, therefore it will be around the production automobile, mainly because it would influence both mind and arm distance. Luckily, the concept does not seem to eliminate a lot of its attractive dimensions using a bigger roofing, a significantly less raked entrance windscreen, an apparent B-pillar, and stainless windows encompass. Other changes towards the car's user profile include fabricating entry care of, a rather larger grille from the front side fender, along with brand new multiple-spoke rims. At the beginning, we rely on typically the 2022 Mazda RX 7 Changes, Interior, HP to obtain an adjusted grille and fender in addition to a new sort of headlamps. While the total size and shape in the production grille need to keep comparable, the apparatus will most likely be given a stainless encompass and additionally the side to side panels observed on all current Mazdas. Listed under, the fender area intakes are a bit bigger on your creating, as the splitter together with the middle segment continued to be unaffected. The headlamps ought to make the most changes as the concept's slim apparatus are far too amazing for any generation engine car. Buthowever, the reduction area will probably rely on Mazda's present headlamp layout; the top, curved Directed strip may find its way around the generation automobile. Finally , we rounded out your creation providing using a standard hood as well as a Mazda logo in the nasal space, while removing the one from the grille. Considering the rear end from the RX-Perspective isn't specifically wilderness, Mazda will probably maintain many of the features in the creation of coupe. The specific RX-7, however, might find an improved tailgate, somewhat re-designed taillights without a"hovering" spoiler, along with various diffusers. Compared to a lot of concept autos, the RX-Eyesight got a neat and basic interior that may go into generation these days. Nevertheless, Mazda will, in all likelihood, alter a couple of things sometimes, for example, device group, the entranceway panels, along with the center unit. The next will probably get the maximum changes since the 2022 Mazda RX 7 Changes, Interior, HP will get a typical middle pile with different control keys along with knobs. A good infotainment system, as well as a big screen, also need to be additional. However, it actually remains to be noted if the screen will be fitted in addition to the dashboard – like found in several present-day Mazda automobiles – or contained in the middle bunch. Additionally, search for multiple-work controls together with a lot more comprehensive tool cluster powering it. In terms of the larger quantities of leather-based and lightweight aluminum inserts observed in typically the notion goes, assume that these folks to be around on increased trims. Similar to the MX-5, the specific RX-7 should be a little bit more cost-effective when compared with its rivals, which means the entrance-stage layout will function much less or no leather material at all. Nonetheless, the cottage should consider looking athletic and are offered in only two-sculpt combos across the bottom variation at exactly the same time. Typically the drivetrain is certainly the RX-7's main secret to date, as Mazda has absolutely nothing to say regarding the engine apart from the proven fact that it will probably be a Wankel and also referred to as the SkyActiv-R. A company agent, even so, suggested that this would use turbocharging, and this the sport vehicle will probably be geared towards the particular Porsche Cayman. Considering the German coupe comes combined with at minimum 275 horsepower in basic toned, the 2022 Mazda RX 7 Changes, Interior, HP, which is less heavy when compared with the Cayman approximately 2,700 pounds, would want no less than 250 horses to make an impact in this particular region of interest. Assume 0 -to-60 miles per hour run of about 5 moments in addition to a top-rated velocity of a minimum of 150 miles per hour. It is absolutely too soon to talk about cost ranges, but it is secure to believe that this RX-7 can become Mazda's priciest thing in the present collection. The previous decal label is set by a lot of aspects. On the other hand, the sport vehicle will likely cost more when compared to $35,000 from the basic clip. 2022 Mazda Rx 7 AWD, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 Colors, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 Cost, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 Coupe, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 Electric, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 Engine, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 Horsepower, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 Hot Wheels, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 Interior, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 Manual, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 MPG, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 Price, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 Release Date, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 Review, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 Rumors, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 Specs, 2022 Mazda Rx 7 Top Speed When Will The 2022 Mazda 6 Be Released 2022 Mazda CX 9 USA Specs, Price, Release
According to LITRA, the Swiss covered more distance by train than anyone else in the world in 2014. An average Swiss resident covered 2,288 km by train, more than twice the distance of an average Brit (1,056 km). Even the French with their world-class high-speed TGV train network were well behind the Swiss with only 1,271 km of train travel for the year. Japan was a reasonably close second with an average of 2,042 km, probably not surprising to anyone who has travelled on Japan's space age high-speed Shinkansen trains with their aircraft-like interiors and serpentine features. Swiss residents also made frequent trips, 59 being the 2014 average. On this measure the Swiss came in behind the Japanese with 72 trips annually. It seems the Japanese take more but shorter trips than the Swiss. Other European countries sit well behind Switzerland on both measures. Austria is in second place in Europe on average per capita distance with 1,378 km, well behind Switzerland's 2,288 km. On frequency Luxembourg is second in Europe with 40 train journeys per resident per annum, only a little over two thirds the number for Switzerland. On this measure Britain achieves less than half the Swiss number with an average of 26 trips over the year. Both Swiss and Japanese trains have a reputation for running on time. Could there be a connection?

Prep Athlete of the Week: Cook critical to… Prep Athlete of the Week: Cook critical to Durham High volleyball team Durham High volleyball player Bethany Cook is the Prep Athlete of the Week. By Joseph Shufelberger | PUBLISHED: November 12, 2014 at 12:00 am | UPDATED: September 8, 2018 at 12:00 am DURHAM >> Sometimes, statistics don"t tell the entire story, or even most of it. The Durham High volleyball team was going to a fifth set at Hamilton in a Nov. 4 Sacramento Valley League match, and Trojans coach Noelle Keese decided to go against her standard move of subbing for Bethany Cook after the senior serves. "I said, "We need her heart,"" Keese recalled telling her assistant. "/I"m going to leave Bethany on because I think her heart is going to make us win this game." We were just in a kind of funk that whole game. I really thought Bethany"s heart and leadership was going to make us win that game." The Trojans won that fifth game and the match 21-25, 25-14, 21-25, 25-23, 15-13. Now, Durham (30-3) has time off this week as the No. 1 seed in the Northern Section Division V postseason field and awaits its next opponent for a contest at home Tuesday. Keese said deviating from the norm was easy when it kept Cook where she was needed. "Bethany has been our biggest leader this year," the Trojans" coach said. "She"s so vocal on the court and off the court, whether she"s playing or if she"s not playing. She is the loudest person. She"s constantly talking, encouraging. She"s always positive." Cook is also among the team"s leaders in several statistical categories for Durham, which has not lost a match against divisional foes. "I"ve been really surprised how people have stepped up," Cook said, as the Trojans have gotten even better after reaching the section final last year but lost some of their top players due to graduation. "We have confidence in each other. It"s all a team effort." While Cook has been playing volleyball since she was 8 years old and wants to keep doing so if she can, she"s focused on extending this season as much as she can. "If I can play somewhere, I"m definitely going to go there first," said Cook, who has a 3.6 GPA and is involved with Future Farmers of America in addition to playing softball. "I"m just really trying to make sure every practice counts. It"s my last year before maybe playing college, maybe not. I wanted to lay everything out on the court."

Ta-dah! Hell and Styx #13, where you get to see a snippet of Heaven's past and how he ended up as who he is today. The flashback story will take a few more posts to finish, but this one introduces the plot line. Maybe that made things a little clearer. Or not. It might be better explained in the actual story. So I'll shut up and you should go read it already! Likes and comments are always open. Also, check out Hell and Styx's new Pinterest board. Heaven let himself vanish from purgatory, drifting back to the human world, his atoms breaking apart and then calmly reassembling themselves in front of a yellowing yard. He ran his hand through his hair and opened the gate, pacing through the dying grass to stand on the front porch. He took a deep breath and held it, reminding himself that Hell was right. He didn't need to breathe. No one could see him. He was fake. He wasn't corporal, so he couldn't knock. So he waited. He remembered a thin girl with blonde hair with a stubborn chin and a freckled, upturned nose. He remembered the sweatshirt with her high school's mascot and the skinny jeans. Back when his obsession with the human world was simply habit, a part of himself he had forgotten to erase when he stopped being human. He liked being invisible. He would walk empty streets, leaving no trace, touching nothing, completely unable to screw anything up. It was 10:00 p.m. and Heaven was walking aimlessly down residential streets, turning onto a street of shops that all closed at five, lost in his thoughts. Yesterday, he went to purgatory to sort a soul, but he knew he wouldn't need to go back for weeks. A nagging in his mind would alert him to the next soul of his, but they were rare. Neither Hell nor Styx had seen him. That was by design. He didn't want the responsibility of being friends, of having to wait around for a person to die on him while they tirelessly did their individual missions. The little girl had gone with him with no complaint. She was intrigued but not particularly scared, as were most of his dead. Her soul was blinding and clean, and Heaven caught himself lingering, not willing to release his drug of choice when he wouldn't get another hit for weeks. Heaven was still remembering the pure rush of joy from the girl's soul, wishing the world had more good people, and that they'd have shorter life spans, jealous of his counterparts, with their cornucopias of dead, when he saw her. She was alone, hair blown across her face by a vanished breeze, hands in her pockets, not afraid, not lonely. Heaven paused to watch her walk toward him, taking in the beauty of her simplicity. She stopped to look in the window of an ice cream shop, pressing her face against the glass, then laughed to herself, free to be happy in the silence. Then she turned to keep walking, and froze. That was Heaven's first thought. "Hey," Heaven said, more taken aback by her beauty than the obvious fact that she could see him. She giggled, pausing beside him, waiting for him to fall into step with her. His mind stuck somewhere between noticing her exact shade of lip gloss—light pink—and the fact that she could see him, did the only thing it could think off. It followed her. "Aren't you cold?" she asked, looking at his collared shirt and dress pants. A breeze whipped by and Heaven realized—it was cold. Like, really cold. How had he never noticed before? Heaven was watching her face as they walked, but even if he had seen the sign outside the restaurant—declaring ALL ENTRES HALF PRICE ON TUESDAYS 3:00-6:00—he wouldn't have avoided it. But today, he should have. Because today, he crashed into it. The sign collapsed against itself and clattered into the ground. Heaven jerked to the right, trying not to step on it, bumping into the girl's sweatshirt. It was soft. Heaven laughed, and wondered if he could eat now that he was solid. Did this mean his duty was over? Nostalgia swept through him like a draft, leaving him with the bitter taste of loneliness in his mouth. "You okay?" she asked, noticing the change in his mood. "Just reminded of something," Heaven said, shaking his head to get the thoughts out. They turned onto the same street Heaven had come from, and the girl slowed her pace. Heaven let her, understanding her need to preserve the night. They walked in silence, until the girl stopped in front of a lawn. Even in the dark, Heaven could tell it was lush and green. "This is my stop," the girl said. It looked human, was what Heaven wanted to say. It was normal, just like this girl, and tonight. "Are we going to see each other again?" she asked. "We're going to need to get you a nickname," Lilith promised. And Lilith let herself into her house and Heaven left, walking straight through her trashcan left out on the street. That was his first night with her. Now, a year and a half later, Heaven stared at the door in front of him. He wasn't in the mood. Not while he was remembering a different yard, and a different girl. There were houses all across the continent, all across the world, that Heaven could visit. Where he had friendships. Where he could live. But tonight, he knew the truth: he was never more than a ghost. And the only person he wanted to see was already gone.
Yup that's right a tea cocktail! I heard about the idea when perusing the Adagio Tea website. It's my new favorite in Chicago. The store just off of the Mag Mile has probably 100 different teas which can be completely intimidating. However, the staff is fabulous! They walk you through and help you find the perfect tea. And let you try it! They will make any tea you want to try and for me it was several. I typically like an earthy, complex black tea and found a great keenum. But I also picked up some Wild Strawberry herbal tea. Which technically has no tea leaves in it but flowers, apples and berries. It's light and not overly sweet. A perfect base for a summer cocktail! Easy, tasty and very refreshing. A Strawberry Tea-tail! Easy tea cocktail that screams summer! Prep tea by steeping in hot water for 5 minutes. Cool tea in the fridge or freezer. Put vodka and tea in the glass.

WBSC Softball Americas Qualifier Down To Final Six (Photo courtesy of WBSC Americas) The WBSC Softball Americas Qualifier is down to its final six teams with the Super Round beginning on Friday afternoon. Puerto Rico and Mexico will open Super Round play when they go head-to-head in what should be the highlight of the Super Round. Mexico won Group B with a perfect record, while Puerto Rico finished second in Group A after suffering a 3-0 loss to Canada. Canada, Cuba, Brazil and Venezuela also moved through to the Super Round, while the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Peru and the Bahamas were all eliminated. The top-two teams after the Super Round will earn an Olympic berth, which is why the first game is so crucial for Puerto Rico. Mexico's undefeated record through pool play earned it a slight advantage, as the two berths are determined by the best record and not an elimination format. Mexico's Tori Vidales, Nicole Mendes and Brittany Cervantes have three of the top batting averages in the tournament, while Puerto Rico leads in the power game with Jena Cozza and Alyssa Rivera each leading the tournament in home runs with two each. It wouldn't be a surprise if Puerto Rico uses Kamalani Dung, Aleshia Ocasio and Taran Alvelo in the circle, while Mexico may go with Dallas Escobedo. Canada continues to roll through the tournament and is headed towards one of the two berths. The Canadians will face Venezuela on Friday before playing Mexico on Saturday and closing out the tournament on Sunday against Brazil. 3:30 p.m. Puerto Rico vs Mexico 6:00 p.m. Venezuela vs Canada 8:30 p.m. Cuba vs Brazil 5:00 p.m. Bahamas vs Dominican Republic 7:30 p.m. Peru vs Guatemala 2:00 p.m. Canada vs Mexico 3:30 p.m. Venezuela vs Cuba 6:00 p.m. Puerto Rico vs Brazil 10:30 p.m. Cuba vs Mexico 1:00 p.m. Venezuela vs Puerto Rico 3:30 p.m. Brazil vs Canada
Great space for this – on the wharf at Walsh Bay. Art and wine. Wine and music. Music and art. All three share synergies, parallels, artistic ideals, the lot. Obviously wine is just a bit more cut and dried than the other two (arguably), yet the commonalities are unmissable (or at least I think so). Given these commonalities then it's probably quite surprising that we don't see more art inspired by wine, especially given that the stereotypical artist drinks plenty of the stuff (particularly at gallery openings) and is probably particularly inspired when influenced by wine. Yet we rarely see much in the way of art dedicated to wine. Penfolds, however, have attempted to address that gap with this latest project. Called 'The Blocks', said project is a collaboration between London designers Studio Twogood and Penfolds, with the art-installation-meets-wine-bar-concept focused particularly on a set of large wooden totems – essentially large wooden sculptures – that are then prepared by a perfumer to showcase some of the scents you might find in (Penfolds) wine. That's someone famous in the background too. The way this 'multi sensory environment' then works is that you wander around the exhibit – which is housed in a pretty cool wharf warehouse space in Sydney's Walsh Bay – accompanied by a 'sommelier' who guides you through the art installation with a selection from the Penfolds Bin/Luxury range to taste as you go. You thus enjoy a glass or two of wine, accompanied by a tasting menu prepared by Magill Estate Executive Chef Jock Monfrillo, and spend plenty of time smelling wood and loitering around looking at art. I was one of said loiterers at the launch a week or so ago, largely to see what Penfolds – whom have a history of toying with art and wine – had managed to bring together, but also to see what this intriguing wood scented totems shenanigans was all about. Now I'm the first to admit that I'm not much of an art critic. I like quite my art classical really (with exceptions), so I'm not probably not very well placed to comment on the quality of the works themselves. Moreso, as one of the few 'wine' people at the launch party I think I stood out as one of the least arty types there – with my distinct lack of rolled up jeans, boat shoes and carefully coiffed hair (for guys). For girls it was one-piece jumpsuits (which apparently are 'so hot right now') and more big hair. Or such. Regardless of such fashion comments, I still liked the exhibtion and thought that the execution was good. The whole operation has an air of professionalism to it, the work clearly created by talented artists. It didn't move me (the art at least) but I was entertained by attempts to pick up scent 'interpretations' from big pieces of wood. Suffice to say that anyone who is used to playing with Le Nuz De Vin or other professional scent kits might be a little baffled too.. As for the wines, there was one particular new release from the Penfolds range that stood out (for me at least). That was the 2010 Penfolds Bin 128 Coonawarra Shiraz, which I think might be the best 128 I've seen in years.. What makes the 128 work is all about simplicity – it's a thoroughly medium bodied Shiraz (as Coonawarra Shiraz should be), with trademark Penfoldian richness but also with a hint of leaf and grainy tannins. Medium weight, understated yet also bold enough to carry the red Penfolds cap. Everything in it's right place. Perhaps a little bit 'airbrushed' but no questioning the appeal. Considering that it's a relatively affordable part of the Penfolds range, it's not hard to give it a big thumbs up. I went back for seconds. Another block. A phallic one. On another tack, they were serving a particularly interesting cocktail on the night too (an expensive one to replicate perhaps) that mixed Bombay Sapphire gin, Lillet and Penfolds Grandfather tawny to make a thoroughly boozy, if quite intriguing (the richness of the old fortified worked great against the straight spirits), mixed drink of choice. Liked that too. Seconds again. Besides the drinks (I saw so little food that I can't comment on what was served. There was 'things on spoons') the whole experience then was a good one. The verdict then on 'The Blocks' is pretty simple – hardly a serious wine tasting experience, but well worth a look, particularly given that it's free (to wander around at least). It's free to wander, but $35 for a four wine tasting it seems a bit on the steep side. The food was also quite pricey – enough so that we split without checking it out.
Jerry Preisendorf Soccer Coach Hired October 23, 2015–Lehi, Utah Jerry Preisendorf has been hired as the men's and women's soccer coach for Skyridge High School, currently under construction in Lehi, Utah. The school will open in August 2016. Coach Preisendorf has a USSF "D" Coaching License and has coached soccer for the last 15 years at the club and high school levels. He has been the head coach of the Lehi High School boys' team since 2010 and started coaching the girls' soccer program in 2015. Under Coach Preisendorf, the boys' program at Lehi High School has collected two state titles, the first in 2010 (4A), and the second in 2013 (5A). The team advanced to the semifinal game last season. During his tenure, the Pioneers have been Region champions four times, and have qualified for the state playoffs every year. The overall record for the boys' team is at Lehi High is 82-24-7. During Preisendorf's first year as the girls' head coach at Lehi High School, the team finished the season as the 4th seed in Region 4 and earned a berth in the state playoffs. Their first round victory over a #1 seed allowed them to make it to the quarterfinals, where they lost to an eventual finalist in the 5A division. Skyridge principal Joel Perkins says, "Jerry is an outstanding individual. He has cultivated a tradition of excellence at Lehi High School, and we are confident that he will create outstanding men's and women's soccer programs. He cares deeply for his student athletes, and he is known for his ability to hone their individual potential to achieve success as a cohesive team. His teams excel, and parents and students love him." Skyridge Athletic Director Mark Clinton says, "Jerry has the ability to understand and demonstrate the importance of teamwork and sportsmanship and will instill in Skyridge athletes a burning desire to win while playing within the rules." On leaving his current position, Preisendorf says, "I have a lot of memories and many good friends at Lehi High School. All of my sons graduated from Lehi, and I have a great relationship with the administration there. I look forward to creating a great program and to the opportunities that come with starting a program at a new school." Coach Preisendorf says the best thing in his life is being married to his wife of over 30 years, Michele. The Preisendorfs have four boys and one grandchild, and they have lived in Lehi for the past 23 years. He will continue to coach at Lehi High through the end of the school year.
Halloween is a time for elaborate costumes, collecting sweet treats, bobbing for apples, telling ghost stories by the light of a jack-o-lantern and watching a scary movie or two. In recent years, Halloween has become even more of an event as people decorate their homes and neighborhoods for the annual fall celebration. Coming just before the onset of winter weather in many parts of North America, Halloween is also a great time for a cruise vacation. The good news is that you won't necessarily miss out on your favorite traditional Halloween activities. Some cruise ships celebrate Halloween with costume contests, treats and activities for all ages. For example, Royal Caribbean ships decorate for the holiday and host costume contests, parades and dance parties. Halloween-themed movies are shown and families can enjoy "scary story time" together. Passengers are welcome to bring their own costumes, but if you forget to pack yours, you can also make one on board. Royal Caribbean ships also have some Halloween activities just for kids, such as making Halloween crafts, trick-or-treating around the ship and exploring a spooky haunted house. In the past, some cruise lines have even offered murder-mystery cruises that coincide with Halloween. For more information on how you can enjoy a spooky good Halloween on a cruise ship, talk with Cruise Holidays.

Crowdsourcing Competitive Innovation Posted by Epi Ludvik | Feb 8, 2017 | Citizen Engagement, Collective Intelligence, Crowdsourcing, Mass Collaboration, Open Innovation | 0 Peter Diamandis is saying: 99.999% of people don't understand or appreciate the ramifications of what is coming and I agree 100% here. Innovation is the essential component when we are considering how to solve the world's biggest challenges, and the best place to source revolutionary ideas is from the crowd. This is something XPRIZE has been doing for over two decades, and is now making a big difference in many areas that matter, not least the field of energy and sustainability with. They are, for example, running a $20m carbon competition which addresses global CO2 emissions by incentivizing innovative solutions to convert CO2 from a liability into an asset, such as fertilizers, concrete and even toothpaste. XPRIZE started out about 20 years ago by offering a prize of $10m to the first privately financed team that could fly a passenger vehicle into space. 26 teams from around the world competed for this, with the first rocket taking off in 2004. The competition was set up to help realise a personal dream of its founder, Peter Diamandis, to be an astronaut. After lift off he realised there was an opportunity to keep going as there was clearly an appetite from the crowd to take on big planetary scale challenges. As their platform says "XPRIZE is a facilitator of exponential change. A catalyst for the benefit of humanity" which utilises the innate competitiveness of humanity to bring about breakthroughs which seemed impossible. The prizes focus on bold, audacious yet achievable goals which target market failure and are winnable by a small team. They are designed to drive investment in the target field and provide vision and hope. Past XPRIZES have included Ocean Health and Oil Clean-Up, with potential future competitions being in Road Electrification and Revolutionary Battery. In addition to the Carbon prize there are another 8 competitions currently running, such as Water Abundance which challenges teams to alleviate the global water crisis with energy-efficient technologies that harvest fresh water from the atmosphere. The Carbon challenge they have set is certainly fits the criteria as a BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal); creating valuable products of essentially thin air and is targeting a considerable market failure: fossil fuels causing climate change. The International Energy Agency estimates 82 percent of the world's energy supply is derived from fossil fuels. Currently virtually all the CO2 this produces instantly becomes a waste product which is dumped into the atmosphere. While cleaner energy sources are on the rise, overall energy demand is expected to grow 37 percent by 2040, making immediate carbon mitigation solutions even more urgent. Teams are challenged to develop breakthrough technologies that convert the most CO2 into one or more products with the highest net value. In October, the judges narrowed down the 47 Round 1 entries down to 27 teams for Round 2 'semi finals' with these remaining teams coming from around the world and pursuing an incredible diversity of approaches. Carbon Capture Machine, who are based at Aberdeen University in Scotland, has a method of producing CO2 based minerals for concrete and other building materials; "The technology we have developed here in Aberdeen offers a bridge to a solution that can prevent damage caused by CO2 emissions and create materials to build the homes and offices of the future." says their team leader Dr Mohammed Imbabi. "The competition is an exciting way to validate our objectives and show we can compete against other outstanding teams" comments Thomas Digby, the CEO of Swiss based start-up company Aljadix. They unquestionably fit the criteria of being an entrant with a small team, having only seven staff comprised of academics and start-up entrepreneurs who are aiming to produce carbon negative biofuel which permanently removes carbon from the atmosphere. Some of the entrants are certainly gaining themselves a high profile. Protein Power from the US are producing high-protein fish food, and their CEO, Lisa Dyson, has a TED talk which has been viewed over one million times. In this she describes how a technology which was developed in the 60s by NASA to enable long distance space travel by using a clever carbon cycle has been adapted to make crops grow incredibly fast. Using this technique, they can grow in the dark, in any season, geography and location. This is pretty useful is space, but also means as Dyson observes in her TED: "At a large scale, you can actually make 10,000 times more output per land area than you could if you used soybeans." By sourcing from the crowd, XPRIZE is enabling a future in which many of the currently seemingly intractable problems we face are solved by innovative enterprises. Climate change is arguably the biggest problem of our time and by creating a future where purified CO2 is, instead of being seen as a criminal waste, is known as the source of our buildings, food and many other essentials to life. As they say at XPRIZE: "Call us crazy, but we believe."

¶ During his campaign for the presidency and since, Obama repeatedly assured us that he would protect Medicare against cuts; but he now presses for passage of bills that include savage cuts in Medicare. ¶ To obtain passage of his first stimulus bill, Obama assured us that 90% of the jobs created would be in the private sector; but as he well knew, most of them were to be in the public sector. ¶ Early in the health care debate, Obama assured us that he had not said that he favored a single payer system; but he was on record as having said exactly that. ¶ Obama gave primary voters a firm assurance that if he became the nominee of the Democratic party he would (unlike Hillary Clinton) abide by the campaign finance limits of public funding; but as soon as he became the party's nominee, he reneged on that pledge. ¶ During the presidential campaign Obama criticized the presence of former lobbyists in the Bush administration and solemnly assured us that he would appoint no lobbyists to his administration; but once elected he proceeded to appoint even more lobbyists than his predecessors. ¶ Obama criticized the size of George Bush's deficit and promised to stop deficit spending if elected; but he has already quadrupled the size of the deficit he objected to and recklessly continues new federal spending in the trillions. ¶ When campaigning Obama criticized bills before the congress that were too long for anyone to be able to read and promised to stop that; but the bills he has been backing throughout his first year are infinitely longer (2000+ pages) than the ones he criticized. ¶ Candidate Obama promised an end to the corruption of earmarks and pork, but in the bills he has supported this year there have been more and bigger earmarks than ever before. ¶ Candidate Obama promised us that CIA personnel involved in the interrogation of terrorists would not be prosecuted; but his administration is now doing exactly that. ¶ Obama assured a joint session of Congress that the health bill he supported (pre-Stupak) would not provide public funding for abortions; but bitter resistance on the part of House Democrats to inclusion of language to that effect soon proved that it did. ¶ Candidate Obama promised that he would make sure that there was always enough time for the public to read legislation before it was enacted; but he has done exactly the opposite, repeatedly pressing for even faster passage of even longer bills. ¶ Candidate Obama met fears that he would be a tax and spend liberal by promising, emphatically and repeatedly, that those earning under $200,000 would see no increase in their taxes of any kind; but he now urges passage of a healthcare bill that breaks that pledge in many different ways, and his unrestrained increase in federal spending makes more tax increases inevitable. ¶ Candidate Obama promised bipartisanship and an end to partisan bickering; but in a display of especially ruthless partisanship his allies have shut Republicans out of all key meetings on his health care initiative, with the unprecedented result that domestic legislation of historic importance garnered not a single Republican vote in the Senate. ¶ Candidate Obama criticized his opponent's plan to tax employer paid healthcare benefits, and promised he would not tax them; but the bill he now backs will do just that. ¶ Obama had promised that he would not sign a healthcare bill that would add one dime to the federal deficit; but the bill he now backs adds trillions in new federal spending, offset only by new sources of revenue that are both uncertain and more properly seen as offsetting the already existing deficit. ¶ Obama coerced congress into passing his stimulus bill by promising that if it were passed unemployment could go no higher then 8%; but unemployment is now at 10%, and he could not possibly have had good reason to exclude that possibility. ¶ Obama promised that his cap and trade legislation will create jobs; but its massive tax increases will certainly hobble the economy and destroy jobs, while green jobs in significant numbers can at best be hoped for, but never promised. ¶ Obama has repeatedly assured the American people that if they like their current health plan they can keep it; but the House bill which he supported created huge incentives for employers to drop their coverage and shift their members to a public option. ¶ Obama has just as often assured the public that under his health plan everyone will be able to keep their current doctor; but many are certain to lose their doctors when ObamaCare's large cuts in Medicare funding induce more doctors to withdraw from Medicare coverage, as they also would were employers to transfer patients to a public option to save money.
Heart pounding. Unblinking eyes glued to the court that bears Lou Henson's name. Sweat pouring like rain drops. It was pretty much everything you would expect from a small town kid making his debut in front of a couple thousand University of Illinois basketball fans. Family selfie at Grace's first-ever college basketball game! And I'm not for sure, but I think Dylan Miller might have been nervous too. As soon as the University of Illinois released their schedule, I had Nov. 15 circled on my calendar. With the exception of it being on a Sunday, a busy day here at the paper, it was the perfect storm for a Hillsboro sportswriter. Just an hour away from Topper Country, Miller would be returning "home" with his new teammates from North Dakota State to take on the University of Illinois at the Prairie Capital Convention Center in Springfield, the Illini's home away from home while the State Farm Center is being redone. The biggest name in Hillsboro High School basketball over the last three years and the first D1 men's basketball player from HHS since 1974, against the biggest college basketball program in the state made me almost have to pinch myself to make sure it was real. Kyle had a blast shooting from courtside! In reality, I knew there was a chance that Dylan might not play that much, if at all, but I held out hope that he would at least see the court. Mary and I bought tickets the day they went on sale, knowing that even if I wasn't able to procure media credentials, we wanted to take Grace to the game. Just a few short months after Grace was diagnosed with Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy, the Hillsboro boys basketball team provided one of our most memorable moments as Dylan helped Grace "dunk" or as close as she will ever come to it (way closer than her daddy ever will). Dylan talking with some teammates at the game. With a guarantee to get into the game already taken care of, I reached out to Wes Offerman, the media contact for the North Dakota State men's basketball team, and he was kind enough to point me in the right direction to get credentials through the University of Illinois. In addition to my request, I also sent Wes a link to the blog Mary did about Grace's experience with Dylan. We have made it our goal to give Grace every experience possible for as long as we have her on this Earth and to spread awareness about INAD to anyone who would listen. And thankfully, Wes listened. We enjoyed getting to meet Coach Richman too! Saturday morning, I received an email from him asking if we could be at the game about 45 minutes early, so we could take Grace down to meet the players and coaches. This remarkable invitation is something that Mary and I may have hoped for, but never would have asked for or expected from a group of complete strangers. As we got to the game, the nerves hit me pretty hard. The familiar orange and blue of the Illini hardwood and watching some of the best players in the country warm-up brought on a little bit of stage fright. Hence the aforementioned sweating and near cardiac arrest that occurred even before the game started. We managed to meet up with Wes, despite some cell phone technical difficulties, and he brought us downstairs to the team's locker room. Grace and mommy cheered from the stands. Coach David Richman was kind enough to take a few moments to meet Grace, Mary and I before the game. He's in his second year as the head coach of the Bison, where he has been a member of the coaching staff in some capacity since 2003, but looks like he could still play for them. As it often does, the conversation turned quickly to kids. Coach Richman has four girls, including a pair of four-year-old twins that reminded me a lot of my own little blond haired sprite. After the quick conversation, we made our way into the locker room, where Coach Richman introduced us and Grace went around and gave out high-fives to all of the players, with an assist from Mary. We realized later that neither of us had bothered to take a photo of the meet and greet, but ultimately you don't always need a picture to remember something unforgettable. The game itself was fun, with North Dakota State leading for most of the game before Illinois got hot late and ended up winning 80-74. Dylan did get to play about two minutes toward the end of the first half, to the joy of the pockets of yellow clad "Miller #42" fans throughout the arena. Grace and I posed for a photo before the game too! He didn't play badly, nor did he set the world on fire, but he played and that's something that only a handful of people can say has happened to them and no one from Hillsboro in the last four decades. The coolest part of the watching the game from the floor for me was seeing senior guard Kory Brown call Miller over after he was taken out and talk to the true freshman. I have no idea what Brown said, but you could see his leadership in that brief conversation and he quickly became my second favorite player on the NDSU roster. The opportunity to see that conversation and to photograph a University of Illinois game from the floor are bucket list items for me normally, but they were just icing on the cake on Sunday. The really special moment was meeting Coach Richman and the team. I know that Grace may not have gotten a lot out of it (she slept through about 75 percent of the game), but the opportunity for her to do something like that is forever etched in my memory. Grace slept through more than half the game, but I certainly didn't mind the snuggles! INAD is awful. I wouldn't wish it on the child of my worst enemy. But it's through this traumatic disease that we have been able to give Grace life experiences that most kids can only dream of. Sometimes God brings special people into our lives that help make the hard times a little easier to manage by giving us good times that are beyond measure. Thanks to Wes Offerman, Coach Richman, Dylan Miller and the entire Bison Family for being those people. Once a Bison Always a Bison! Welcome to Bison Nation and the Bison Family. Go Bison!
Q: WAN security and port forwarding for IoT I have an esp8266 board that I've set up as a little server. To access it over the web (first forays into making a smart home and IoT) I've used no-ip to deal with dynamic DNS and opened up WAN access with port forwarding (80) on my home router. My question is how secure is this? I've tried only allowing a certain IP address but smart phones use dynamic IPs. A: When dealing with TCP/IP connections, there are 65535 ports available to listen on. Generally, port 80 is used for standard HTTP connections, while port 443 is used for HTTPS. If you need to open up a common port to the world, be ready to server any request that is made to it. Another option would to be changing the port you are listening on, this should be a number between 5000 and 65535. By randomizing this port, only you will know how to connect. ( you will need admin access to bind to any port < 1024 ) If you wtill want to server standard HTTP data, the URL would simply be http://my.no-iphost.com:55933/my_script Where 55933 is my secret port.
Induction of apoptosis by pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) hull extract and its molecular mechanisms of action in human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Several important Pistacia species such as P. vera have been traditionally used for treating a wide range of diseases (for instance, liver-related disorders). There is a relative lack of research into pharmacological aspects of pistachio hull. Hence, this study was aimed at investigating whether pistachio rosy hull (PRH) extract exerts apoptotic impacts on HepG2 liver cancer cell line. In order to evaluate cell viability and apoptosis in response to treatment with the extract, MTT assay and Annexin-V-fluorescein/propidium iodide (PI) double staining were performed, respectively. Moreover, molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by the extract was determined using human apoptosis PCR array. Our findings showed that PRH extract treatment reduced cell viability (IC50 ~ 0.3 mg/ml) in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the extract significantly induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. In addition, quantitative PCR array results demonstrated the regulation of a considerable number of apoptosis-related genes belonging to the TNF, BCL2, IAP, TRAF, and caspase families. We observed altered expression of both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes associated with the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways. These results suggest that the aqueous extract of PRH possesses apoptotic activity through cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing effects on HepG2 cells.
Planning your trip is certainly a pleasant chore. Here, we make some suggestions on the best ways to travel to Koh Samui. These trips normally consist of a flight to Bangkok followed by an additional leg to the island of Samui. As of today, direct flights are available to Samui from various cities overseas, such as Hong Kong (Bangkok Airways), Singapore (Bangkok Airways) and Kuala Lumpur (Berjaya Air and Firefly). Also keep in mind that Bangkok Airways and Thai Airways can take you to Samui from Bangkok as well as other Thai cities, giving you a chance to get to know the mainland before you plunge into the crystal-clear waters near your vacation home on the island. Getting to the Thai capital is fairly straightforward. Dozens of airlines offer regular flights to Bangkok from cities in Europe, America, Asia and Oceania. Often, you can save money by flying via an indirect route, and chances are low that you will have to endure a long grueling changeover. Carriers like Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways provide excellent service overall and make sure that your transfer process is as comfortable as possible. Having tried the services of many carriers, Samuiland recommends that travelers fly with Thai Airways, the national carrier of the Kingdom of Thailand. On its direct flights to Bangkok, the company offers a truly unrivalled level of service and attention to detail. Families vacationing with kids are sure to appreciate the comfort provided by the staff on Thai Airways. We also recommend planning your trip in advance. This is because last minute tickets purchased during high season, i.e. in December, January or August, are always much more expensive than tickets purchased months beforehand. An hour long roundtrip flight from Bangkok to Koh Samui costs approximately US$300 per adult passenger. The carriers offering this service are Bangkok Airways and Thai Airways which depart every hour from 6 am to 10 pm. A budget traveler can also get to Koh Samui through a combination of different routes (plane, train and bus). Taking a ferry from the mainland to the island is necessary as part of such a travel plan. Getting to Samui in this way is tiresome and we do not recommend it. Besides, there is always the danger of a ferry service delay due to stormy weather.

Q: DAX Query to get average of a column within the same table We have a table named MetricsTable which has columns A1 and Group simply. We want to add a calculated column AvgA1 to this table which calculates the average of column A1 filtered by the value of Group . What should be our DAX query? The point is that we want to claculate the average from the values within the same table. | id | A1| Group | AvgA1 | -- | --- | --- ------| ---- | 1 | 20 | Group1| 20 | 2 | 10 | Group2| 30 | 3 | 50 | Group2| 30 | 4 | 30 | Group2| 30 | 5 | 35 | Group3| 35 Regards A: Likely you should use a measure and put that measure into a pivot table's 'Values' section: AverageA1:= AVERAGE( Metrics[A1] ) Then it will be updated based on filter and slicer selections in the pivot table, and subtotaled appropriately across various dimension categories. If it strictly needs to be a column in the table for reasons not enumerated in your question, then the following will work: AverageA1 = CALCULATE( AVERAGE( Metrics[A1] ) ,ALLEXCEPT( Metrics, Metrics[Group] ) ) CALCULATE() takes an expression and a list of 0-N arguments to modify the filter context in which that expression is evaluated. ALLEXCEPT() takes a table, and a list of 1-N fields from which to preserve context. The current (row) context in the evaluation of this column definition is the value of every field on that row. We remove the context from ALL fields EXCEPT those named in arguments 2-N of ALLEXCEPT(). Thus we preserve the row context of [Group], and calculate an average across the table where that [Group] is the same as in the current context.
When you think of Enterprise E-commerce software, the two names that are bound to come to your mind are Shopify Plus and Big Commerce. Among the top enterprise E-commerce platforms, these two are the major contenders for the throne. So, how do you decide which to choose when faced with Big Commerce vs. Shopify Plus? Well, you can't pick either without knowing where the two platforms stand in different measures. You must first conduct an Enterprise E-commerce platform comparison. We are here to help you out. Here is an Enterprise E-commerce comparison between Shopify Plus vs. Big Commerce Enterprise based on two major measures. The first measure for any user should be ease of use. Think about it. Are you willing to spend time trying to figure out a platform? Probably now. Therefore, opting for platforms that are highly easy to use is the objective of many users. Big Commerce is excellent when it comes to delivering ease of use. This stems from Big Commerce's ability to take risks. Its approach to user experience is unique. Some might find it inconvenient as it is different than what users are used to. However, when you give it a chance, you realize that Big Commerce gives you much better control of your store than any other platform does. Shopify is very easy to use as well. Those who are familiar with the working of WordPress, you would find it very easy to navigate through the interface of Shopify. However, this familiarity and ease don't extend to second level navigation. After the first level, the navigation and the various processes can feel annoying. When it comes to ease of use, Big Commerce wins the run in the long-run, even though at first glance you might prefer Shopify. How do platforms deliver plug-ins and add-ons? They do so via their app store. So, it is a given that you should assess the app stores offered by Big Commerce vs. Shopify. The app store offered by Big Commerce works smoothly and is full of various advantageous plugins and add-ons. You will find the masses raving about the app store. Shopify's app store is packed with advanced tools, features, plug-ins, and add-ons. According to reviews about the store, users have found it to be convenient to use. Both Shopify and Big commerce are equally good as far as their app stores are concerned. Both Shopify and Big Commerce have their merits. You have to decide what weight to give to each.
Life in Research Apply for training grants for early career researchers By: Guest contributor, Tue Oct 6 2020 Author: Guest contributor With international travel harder than ever, and most scientific – and personal – interactions moving online, the Nature Communications journals have adapted our grant scheme for Early Career Researchers to fit these challenging times. Written by Joe Aslin, Associate Editor for Communications Earth & Environment, Nature The Communications journals (Communications Biology, Communications Chemistry, Communications Earth & Environment, Communications Materials and Communications Physics) have, for the past two years, offered travel grants for promising early career researchers to attend conferences for which they would otherwise lack the funding. Of course, the current COVID-19 pandemic and resulting restrictions on international travel have seen scientific meetings and workshops around the world re-organise as online-only events. With travel grants now effectively useless, but support for the careers of young researchers more important than ever, the Communications journals have re-thought our early career grants scheme for 2020. We are now accepting applications for training grants to help early career researchers attend online training courses or workshops. If the event is actually being held in a physical location then these grants can of course still be used for that. Unlike previous years, where a single grant of €1,500 was awarded per journal, this year each title will be awarding multiple grants of up to €500 to cover the cost of registration on a training course, workshop or meeting of the applicant's choice happening anytime during 2021. To apply you must be: a PhD student or a postdoc within 5 years of completion of your PhD conducting research in one of the fields covered by the Communications journals and able to demonstrate that you have no other funds available to attend the course or workshop. Full eligibility criteria can be found on our guidelines for applicants. The deadline for applications is 26th October 2020 and the winners will be announced in early December. If you think you could make use of this grant, we encourage you to apply. If you know of someone else who may be eligible then please let them know and spread the word! This is a very tough time for early career researchers but we hope these grants can go some way to helping keep the next wave of promising scientists learning their trade, developing their skills and interacting with their communities. About Joe Aslin: Joe joined Communications Earth & Environment in January 2020 and has a background in tectonics and structural geology. His doctoral research at the University of Liverpool focused on the physical and chemical processes which influence deformation in mid-crustal fault and shear zones using a combination of field and laboratory techniques. Prior to that, Joe used U-Pb geochronology to investigate the uplift and tectonic history of the central Andes during his MSci research at the University of Bristol. Joe is based in the London office. Guest Contributors include Springer Nature staff and authors, industry experts, society partners, and many others.

How Is The NHS Going To Apply AI? AI is going to play a huge role in the future of healthcare, which is why the UK government recently pledged £250 million to develop AI in the NHS. They intend to use this to improve treatments of conditions including cancer, dementia and heart disease. So where is this money actually going to go? The Department of Health will use the investment for a cutting-edge National Artificial Intelligence Lab. The main goal of the lab will be to use AI to detect and diagnose life-threatening diseases like cancer and dementia at an early stage. Early detection is one of the most important factors in developing an effective, and often life-saving treatment. This technology can also improve cancer screening: AI algorithms can use big data to speed up the delivery of test results of mammograms, brain scans, eye scans playing a crucial role in conditions affecting millions every year. One of the most exciting new proposals of the AI lab is to develop technology which can use DNA tests to identify which patients have the highest genetic risk of certain diseases, making way for early diagnosis and effective treatment. By pre-empting risks, healthcare professionals can act earlier and save patients from diseases which would otherwise be life threatening. Of course, all of this will be a waste if the NHS aren't ready to adopt the innovations available with AI. This is why part of the program includes training and upskilling for AI staff to develop the use of state-of-the-art AI within our existing healthcare system. Once the staff are ready, and a secure AI system is developed, everything from surgery to routine paperwork has the potential to be improved through automation. This doesn't mean AI is coming to replace jobs in the NHS, but that it will enable clinicians to spend more time on the important aspects of medical imaging, like patient care. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that the funding is set to 'boost the frontline by automating admin tasks and freeing up staff to care for patients'. Investment in AI will keep growing over the coming years, and this funding boost will improve healthcare through AI's ability to automate processes, analyse scans, and even develop new methods of diagnosis. Stay at the forefront of this critical medical area, sign up for the AI and Machine Learning Convention to see some of the world's most exciting AI technology, which will be crucial to the future of healthcare over the next few years. The AI and Machine Learning Convention is part of Mediweek 2020, the UK's largest healthcare event showcasing over 50 expert speakers and 50 innovative exhibitors across Oncology, AI and Medical Imaging. Over 500 AI professionals will be attending the AI and ML convention, as part of the 5000 medical imaging and oncology professionals attending Mediweek 2020.

Officials at 4 Factories Accused Of Violating Wage, Safety Laws a Wall Street Journal Staff Reporter Sept. 4, 1996 12:04 am ET NEW YORK -- Officials from four garment factories, including one making apparel for Kmart Corp. under the Kathy Ireland label, were charged with violating minimum-wage laws and creating hazardous workplace conditions. The Kings County District Attorney's Office said workers at one location were being paid as little as $2.67 an hour, compared with the state's legal minimum wage of $4.25. Workers at the other three factories were being paid by the piece, which is also against state law. Investigators also found various safety violations, including locked exits at three factories.

It is no longer the rare chef who decides to take a step back from meat and focus on vegetables. Over the last few years, vegetables have become the new hot kid, welcomed and sought after, be it in chef Alain Passard's famed halls of L'Arpège in Paris, or the uncomplicated Greenwich Village dining room of Nix in New York that has been all the rage since it opened earlier this year. Few restaurants, however, have turned their attention to seafood. The most notable exception is chef Eric Ripert's three-Michelin-starred Le Bernardin in New York, but even Chef Ripert allows a place or two for meat on his menu. There are probably few other restaurants in the world that dedicate their attention as unwaveringly to seafood as chef Kotaro Meguro's Abysse in Tokyo. The 30-year-old chef, who previously trained at Le Petit Nice in Marseilles and Quintessence in Tokyo, forgoes meat dishes entirely on his menu, turning an unwavering focus to the fruits of the ocean. The menu started with a chilled ginkgo soup cradling some soft-shell turtle jelly, swirling together into a bright and refreshing blend of umami and bitterness. The bread was accompanied by an exceptionally fruity olive oil from Provence. The first course was a vibrantly colored plate of botan shrimps from Hokkaido and octopus from Ehime. The botan shrimps were strikingly sweet and gelatinous, while the octopus were tender but didn't add too much in terms of flavor. These were adorned with little bundles of sea grapes that exploded in tiny bursts of brininess and umami, as well as some chicory and figs. A drizzle of sweet beetroot juice and a quenelle of mascarpone mousse tinged with a hint of wasabi completed the dish. In a shocking contrast against the bright colors of the previous plate, the pan-fried hamo was served in a stark ocean of blackness. But the dish possessed more dimension than the colors would let you believe – salty with a purée of eggplant and squid ink, sweet with a crumble of eggplant skin, and dark with some charred trumpet mushrooms. A signature at Abysse, the soupe de poisson was made with lobster and no less than seven kinds of fish, daringly spiced with cayenne, anise, saffron and, in an inspired touch, orange. The complex and powerful flavors lingered persistently, carrying a memory of the profound ocean depth after which the restaurant was named. After the intensity of the soup, the delicate flavors of the silver pomfret felt a bit too timid and subdued, but built slowly in umami. Variations of pistachio crowded the fish, the verdant blend of oil and purée studded with roasted whole pistachios, while plump little parcels of butternut squash added pops of color and sweetness. For dessert, a delicious dacquoise was crowned with Nagano grapes and sheathed beneath a canopy of vanilla jelly, sat on a bed of cream cheese powder. A light and elegant dessert that showcased the amazing flavor of Nagano grapes. Chef Meguro's dedication to seafood showed in his understanding of the ingredients. My meal gave the impression of a kitchen that knows its way around what the ocean has to offer, delivering flavors that were uncomplicated but delightful all the same. If my lunch was anything to go by – and if the fully booked dining room on a Monday afternoon was any sign – Abysse's decision to focus on the great ocean depth certainly paid off.

Magnolia was once known as Mink's Prairie (in the 1840s). The name was shortened to Mink in 1850, but it wasn't until 1885 when the town was granted a post office under the name of Mink. By 1900, the population of the Montgomery County town had swollen to 25 people and two years later, with the arrival of the International-Great Northern Railroad, tiny Mink moved to the tracks, creating a new town. The railroad wanted the town to be named Melton, which was too close (in spelling) to Milton, Texas. So to keep things simple, the town was named after the abundant Magnolia trees – and the new post office was so designated in 1903. reprinted from Texas Escapes | photo by photomajik Residents pronounce the name of the town, Tow, as if it rhymed with "cow," rather than "toe" as might be expected.

Sterling Silver 17x23.6mm 19 gauge Large Flower Earwire, 15.1mm Hibiscus with 2mm Open Ring ID. Order 2pcs to get one pair of earrings. I was surprised how pretty these are in person and by the size. Once I made the finished product with them I was very pleased. They are big but I find them to be a real statement piece. I don't use them often but with special items. The pictures online of this ear wire don't even begin to compare to show how pretty this ear wire is in real life. The flower is large so it may not be suitable for all. It will be the focus of any earring made. The only thing I would change about this ear wire is to make the leg of the actual ear wire just a bit longer.
THE METROPOLITAN Manila Development Authority (MMDA) has recommended to the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) the narrowing down of lane width along EDSA to give way to an additional one as part of its traffic solution scheme. "There was already a discussion with DPWH… The existing lanes will be narrowed to accommodate one more lane.

Plant a Tree for Leilani Leilani M (Booska) Norman September 9, 1941 ~ January 12, 2022 (age 80) Monson-Leilani May Norman, 80, beloved wife of 62 years of Harold Richard Norman passed away on January 12, 2022. Leilani was born September 9, 1941 in Montague, MA to the late Alfred F. Booska and Mary L. (Sawyer) Keller. It is hard to summarize a life well lived in a few paragraphs. Leilani and the love of her life, Harold, were married in 1959 and the adventure began. She started knitting at the age of 6 and never stopped. You could always tell that she was feeling good when you saw her knitting, or doing any of her other crochet, needlework, or sewing projects. She always had multiple projects going and often was making things for family or charity projects, including the military. Leilani was an avid enthusiast of life, and a lifelong learner. She always wanted to be better at whatever she was doing, and was a great example that a woman could do anything that she set her mind to. This made her a powerful role model to her children and grandchildren and made them all strive to be better and make her proud. Leilani and Harold built a house in Montgomery, Ma, started a family, and moved to Monson, Ma in 1969. After Harold took a lapidary course, he taught her, and she went from there to become an experienced stone cutter, gemstone faceter, silversmith, goldsmith, and lost wax caster. They formed the Aloha Rock Shop aka/ Aloha Gems and Minerals. They were members of the CT Valley Mineral Club, and collected and sold at gem and mineral shows for many years. Following back surgery, that limited her mobility, her interests expanded to orchids. Harold had made the "mistake" of giving her a couple of orchids, and so started her obsession with growing them. They were members of the CT Orchid Society and joined the Amherst Orchid Society in 1987. The American Orchid Society was later joined and they traveled to attend conferences, meetings, and events connected to orchids. Their business became Aloha Enterprises, when they added orchids to their sales. They became exhibitors and vendors at the Amherst Orchid Society Spring shows, winning many awards for their exceptional plants and having many returning customers, this continued until Feb. of 2020, which was their final show. They were vendors at the Brimfield Farmers Market in the summers and had added perennials to their other offerings. She always asked people who purchased her plants to call her if they had questions or if their plant did not thrive, as she wanted to make sure that they were successful at their growing. She always felt that you could never have too much education and strived to learn something new every day. She leaves her loving and devoted husband of 62 years, Harold R. Norman; their children; Tracy A. Norman and her husband Edward Shearer of Northfield, MA, Richard F. Norman and his wife Rosa of Goldsboro, NC, and Renee M. Lagacy and her husband John of Tehachapi, CA; a brother Steven Booska and his wife Amanda of CA; a sister Betty Moore and her husband Larry of CA; twelve grandchildren and three great grandchildren. Leilani had always requested that she receive flowers when she was alive, and not after she had passed. She wanted to be able to enjoy them. Please honor her wishes. In her memory, in lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Shriners Hospitals for Children, 516 Carew St. Springfield, MA 01104. All services are private. To send sympathy gifts to the family or plant a tree in memory of Leilani M (Booska) Norman, please visit our tribute store. Services are to be announced
Family from Holland Originally from Spain "...[they] settled in Amsterdam after the expulsion." "As far as I can tell from the genealogy records, [my mother's] family came from Holland in the mid-1850s and settled in the central London area in the Jewish district. My [maternal] grandfather was a cigar maker and also worked with stained glass, so he was an artisan. He did spend time in the Merchant Marines during World War I, but the family name, Decker, is most likely Dutch, and it was, I believe, originally Dukker, d-u-k-k-e-r, until they spelled it the English way. I don't have any direct evidence, but from what my grandmother shared from her knowledge, it's believed that they were originally from Spain and settled in Amsterdam after the expulsion in the late – excuse me—in the early 1490s."

When you visit friends or go shopping in our villages it is often possible to take a much shorter route on foot then would be possible when driving, if you use the extensive network of public footpaths and snickets that provide short-cuts between streets. See the map in the Civic Society newsletter for more information about these routes. Whilst we believe the snickets marked on this map are of long standing use by residents, we are not claiming a public right of way. Thank you to all the members who contributed their local knowledge to this project.

(Fundació CatDem) As matters currently stand and pending the discussion of some outstanding issues, the referendum for the independence of Scotland is likely to take place at some point in autumn 2014. This is, without a shadow of a doubt, a historic moment, not just for Scotland and the UK, but also for the European Union. A positive outcome would lead to a process of negotiation between the UK and the Scottish governments which, ultimately, would result in the first truly internal enlargement in the history of the European Union –not taking into account the reunification of Germany back in 1990-. It is true that polls currently indicate that there is not a clear majority for independence in Scotland. However, it is also true that neither in 2007 nor in 2011 polls ever indicated the extension of the victories that the Scottish National Party (SNP) achieved in the respective Scottish Parliament elections. In light of the SNP's past results, we should not underestimate the Scots' capacity of medium / short-term reaction. This is more so if we take into account the long distance that the Scots have walked in just 13 years of self-government and we compare it against the distance that the Catalans have walked since the second restoration of the Catalan Generalitat, 35 years ago. The movement for self determination is supported by Scottish Greens and Scottish Socialist Party in addition to the SNP. There is sufficient time for YesScotland campaign to gain a majority.

Auto body shop HR attorney: Employers can require COVID-19 vaccines — but tread carefully By John Huetter on May 13, 2021 Announcements | Associations | Business Practices | Education | Legal | Repair Operations Collision industry human resources attorney Cory King last month said body shops and other companies can demand workers receive COVID-19 coronavirus vaccinations. However, the business could find itself in a "pack of trouble" without first educating itself and seeking assistance on the topic, he said. Which is a good time to bring up our usual caveat: None of the comments and analysis presented here are intended as legal advice; they're for informational purposes only. Seek qualified counsel licensed in the relevant jurisdiction before taking any action. "The short answer is: Yes, you can," King, an attorney at FordHarrison, said of workplace vaccination requirements. But it's more complicated than that, he told the April 21 Collision Industry Conference. King said they've seen "a lot of employers screwing up." One of the potential pitfalls lies in the prequalification questioning prior to the vaccination. It's possible these inquiries could trigger an Americans with Disabilities Act violation — particularly if the employer hosts a vaccination clinic in-house, King warned. The employee is answering a question for the employer, and it's assumed the employer has access to the answers, he explained. If the vaccine is strongly encouraged by the business but ultimately voluntary and the questions voluntary, the business might be on safer ground, according to King. "Pre-vaccination medical screening questions are likely to elicit information about a disability," the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission wrote in December 2020." This means that such questions, if asked by the employer or a contractor on the employer's behalf, are 'disability-related' under the ADA. Thus, if the employer requires an employee to receive the vaccination, administered by the employer, the employer must show that these disability-related screening inquiries are 'job-related and consistent with business necessity.' To meet this standard, an employer would need to have a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that an employee who does not answer the questions and, therefore, does not receive a vaccination, will pose a direct threat to the health or safety of her or himself or others." This ADA-question issue isn't a concern if employees arrange their work-mandated vaccines themselves at third-party locations, such as local drugstores, rather than through an employer-hosted clinic, according to King. "By contrast, there are two circumstances in which disability-related screening questions can be asked without needing to satisfy the 'job-related and consistent with business necessity' requirement," the EEOC wrote in December 2020. "First, if an employer has offered a vaccination to employees on a voluntary basis (i.e. employees choose whether to be vaccinated), the ADA requires that the employee's decision to answer pre-screening, disability-related questions also must be voluntary. 42 U.S.C. 12112(d)(4)(B); 29 C.F.R. 1630.14(d). If an employee chooses not to answer these questions, the employer may decline to administer the vaccine but may not retaliate against, intimidate, or threaten the employee for refusing to answer any questions. Second, if an employee receives an employer-required vaccination from a third party that does not have a contract with the employer, such as a pharmacy or other health care provider, the ADA 'job-related and consistent with business necessity' restrictions on disability-related inquiries would not apply to the pre-vaccination medical screening questions." However, should the employee go out to a third-party location and decline to answer the prescreening questions or are denied the vaccine because of their answers, "you cannot ask them why they did not get vaccinated," King said. Your inquiry could run afoul of the ADA and have "crossed the line into a place that you do not want to be," he said. The company might need to accommodate the worker or give them another opportunity to pursue the vaccine, he said. A shop might also need to be cognizant of the chance a worker might claim a religious or "sincerely held" belief exemption, something protected by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. An employer might have to provide reasonable accommodation in such a circumstance. King said the law is very broad, and employers aren't allowed to ask the employee whether they sincerely hold a belief. If the employee tells you to "'go pound sand'" on Title VII grounds, "that is not the time to pick the fight," King said. King said he's encountered numerous instances of employers who recount having told an employee, "'I don't care what the religion says'" and not to come back to work. The company felt public health trumped religion. "Not quite," King said. In fact, the employee was "probably right," he said. Instead, be polite, tell an employee citing a Title VII exemption that you'll look into it, and call an employment lawyer, King said. The employer could be on "very dangerous ground," but "you can make it through," King said. It's possible the workplace can claim that accommodating a client would place an undue hardship on an employer, according to King. The EEOC as of Wednesday said the Supreme Court has defined an "undue hardship" worthy of an employer exemption as "more than a de minimis cost." The agency calls this a lower bar for employers to meet for an accommodation exemption than the "an action requiring significant difficulty or expense" definition within the ADA. What about other reasons cited by an employee for refusing to be vaccinated, such as caution over side effects or a conspiracy theory? Fear of the vaccine, for example, "is not going to be a protected category," King said. But an employer should contact an employment lawyer before firing such an employee or overruling their objection and ordering a vaccine, he indicated. If the worker's argument wanders into a protected category, "you must be very, very careful," King said. "Social, political, or economic philosophies, as well as mere personal preferences, are not religious beliefs protected by Title VII," the EEOC states. "However, overlap between a religious and political view does not place it outside the scope of Title VII's religion protections." Many other issues might arise with employers requiring vaccinations besides the ones featured here, according to King. Potential considerations could include organized labor, OSHA regulations and wage and hour policies. We repeat: Consult with a qualified expert before taking action. As of 6 a.m. Tuesday, 46.2 percent of the population and 58.5 percent of adult Americans (18 years or older) have received at least one vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC said 35.1 percent of Americans and 44.7 percent of adults are considered fully vaccinated. "What You Should Know About COVID-19 and the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Other EEO Laws" Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Dec. 16, 2020 EEOC COVID-19 webpage Centers for Disease Control COVID-19 vaccine website Featured images: FordHarrison attorney Cory King at the April 21, 2021, Collision Industry Conference discussed considerations for employers desiring to require COVID-19 vaccines.

But unknown to Bilal and Yael, theirs is the last and bloody chapter in a story that crosses millennia. Century after century, two ancient families – bloodline ancestors of Yael and Bilal – defied the corrupt power of kings and conquerors, and their struggles forged a fiercely proud people and an enduring hope for peace. But through war and atrocity, kinships were shattered, forcing dynasties apart and allowing evil to gain a foothold. And in modern Israel, confronted with exposure, those sinister forces will do anything to take control of the Holy Land and silence Yael and Bilal, who must run for their lives. Through imprisonment, assassination attempts and political machinations, they must ultimately confront the truth of who they are.

Ex-negotiator: China may be signaling it's going hard-line — but it still wants a trade deal Former top White House trade negotiator Clete Willems China may have just signaled it's going more hard-line on trade, but it could actually be a good thing, former top White House trade negotiator Clete Willems, told CNBC on Wednesday. Beijing added a new member to its negotiating team last week: Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, who's seen by many officials in Washington as a hard-liner. It could be a sign that Chinese leader Xi Jinping is standing firm on trade, analysts say. The Chinese minister was present at last month's G20 summit. He also participated in a phone conversation with US trade representatives last week. By adding Zhong to the negotiating team, it shows that Xi is trying to win over the hard-liners, said Willems, who left his role as deputy director of the National Economic Council (NEC) in March. "China has now elevated its commerce minister Zhong Shan and made him a part of the core negotiating team along with (Vice Premier) Liu He. A lot of people are nervous — he's seen as a hard-liner," Willems told CNBC's 'Squawk Box'. But he's not overly concerned. "I actually think it's a good thing because what it shows is that President Xi is trying to get buy-in from both the hard-line within China and the reformers, which is going to be necessary ingredients for a deal," Willems said. "President Xi is only going to be able to get a deal if the hard-liners are bought in," he added. Flexibility needed Willems has served as the lead trade negotiator for the US at summits like the G7 and G20, and also participated in trade talks in Washington and Beijing. He was a right-hand man to NEC Director Larry Kudlow on trade with China. According to Willems, the Chinese team did try to 'show flexibility' during the talks, but things turned around after they returned to Beijing. "What ended up happening is that when Liu He brought the deal back to President Xi and to the entire political class in China, there was a bit of a rebellion from hard-liners who didn't think the deal was good from China's standpoint," Willems said. "So there's going to need to be flexibility, but I think China has shown they're willing to put these things on the table," added Willems, who's now a partner at international law firm Akin Gump. US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that there's still a long way to go to reach a deal with China. He also threatened to slap tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods. But Willems told CNBC that a deal will ultimately be reached. "My inclination is that we will get a deal, I think that a lot of really good work was done. I think it's in both sides' interest to harvest that work," he said. "I think China's economy — whether or not they want to admit it — is in a little bit of a difficult situation, and it's in their interest to get a deal." The prolonged trade battle seems to be taking a toll on the Chinese economy. Data on Monday showed its economic growth slowed to 6.2 percent in the second quarter — the weakest rate in at least 27 years.

Student Experiences & Engagement » Diversity & Cultural Engagement sjretreat_background.png There are several retreats that support social change offered at Oregon State: Racial Aikido, Multiracial Aikido, International Student Social Justice Retreat, and Examining White Identity in a Multicultural World. As a partnership between Community Engagement & Leadership (CEL), Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS), Diversity & Cultural Engagement (DCE), Office of Institutional Diversity, and University Housing & Dining Services (UHDS), these weekend long retreats promote a campus dialogue about race and racism. Each of the retreats engage in the active exploration of the concept of race and how race influences our lived experiences and interactions. Racial Aikido Retreat Racial Aikido explores the experiences of Students of Color (SOC) at OSU and beyond. Our focus for the 2021 experience is on community-building, the recognition of identity and racism, and response and replenishment to these realities. Our goal is to build a supportive network to learn and thrive at OSU and beyond. For more information or any accommodations related to disabilities, please contact: [email protected] Multiracial Aikido Multiracial Aikido (MRA) is founded on the principles and history of the Racial Aikido retreat. MRA explores systems of racial oppression and centers experiences of multiracial, multiethnic, transracial, and mixed heritage individuals. We offer a supportive learning environment for participants to unpack racial and ethnic identity through storytelling and to build a community of peers and mentors who support their growth. We hope that by the end of the retreat participants will have found commonality in their various experiences and identify tools to navigate, heal, and make meaning as racialized beings in a U.S. context. International Student Social Justice Retreat The International Students' Social Justice Retreat was launched at OSU in February 2016 in the spirit of initiating dialogue on issues of diversity, ethnicity, race, and nationality in the U.S., this retreat helps international students understand the socio-historical American narrative on race and ethnicity, and provides international students with skills to manage and disrupt discrimination based on their perceived identities. Examining White Identity This 3 part series is designed for White-identified students to deepen their understanding of and commitment to racial justice work and anti-racism practice. Participants will engage in storytelling, dialogue, embodiment exercises, and more in order to gain strategies and tools for engaging in racial justice conversations, disrupting racism, and identifying next steps on their personal journeys. Together, we will explore how anchoring this work to love increases our ability to develop authentic relationships and sustain engagement over the long term. This offering is a part of a movement to grow a community of White-identified students committed to racial justice at OSU. Join us! Student Affairs is dedicated to principles of equity and social justice, and as such, all of our events and programs are inclusive to all who are committed to transformative learning.

Enjoyable little app for basic photo enhancements. XnRetro is the little sibling of the more comprehensive XnView. The app is pretty much hassle-free and user-friendly, but it offers limited tools. XnRetro is an okay photo companion for users who need all the essential features that make a photography app usable, from processing to sharing, without sophistications and convoluted controls. Open photos in other apps. XnRetro is a very straightforward app with basic features for simple and quick photo enhancements. It comes with a reasonable collection of retro looking filters and frames ready to use. It includes several light textures (leaks, bokeh, and other effects) with adjustable opacity, vignette styles, and the possibility to add grain and to edit brightness, contrast and saturation of images. Edited photos can be posted to Facebook and Twitter, can be uploaded to Dropbox or can be sent via email, also as PDF files. Moreover, photos can be opened in other apps for further editing. Unfortunately, the app doesn't allow full resolution saving (the maximum I managed to save is 1536 x 1560); apparently, from the in-app settings you can select an option for exporting original sized images to the device's photo library, but I couldn't get it to work. Even with its limitations, XnRetro does a bit of everything average users will need for their pictures. Casual shooters and people willing to share photos after applying slight modifications, attractive retro looking filters, and fancy borders will definitely have fun with this app. XnRetro works both on iPhone and iPad. The app is currently free in the App Store (previously it was $0.99). If you are curious, give it a try now.

Professional > Technical > Luncheons > January 23rd, 2013 Post-earthquake seismic reflection survey, Christchurch, New Zealand, with some new insights into faults Dr. Don Lawton Dept.of Geoscience, U of C Wednesday, January 23rd, 2013 – 10:30 AM MST On September 4, 2010, an earthquake struck the Christchurch region in New Zealand. The Mw 7.1 quake was centered about 40 km west of the city of Christchurch and caused significant damage but no loss of life. A key manifestation of the earthquake was a fault (Greendale Fault) that ruptured to the ground surface with a maximum dextral displacement of 5.1 m and a vertical displacement of 1.5 m, upthrown to the south. On February 22, 2011, a Mw 6.2 aftershock struck with a shallow hypocenter very close to Christchurch. This earthquake resulted in the loss of 182 lives and devastating damage (|$23B) to the city infrastructure. Since September, 2010, the region has experienced over 10,500 aftershocks, with 42 of these being greater than 5M. Approximately 45 line-km of high-fold reflection seismic data were recorded in and around Christchurch following the February 22, 2011 aftershock. The goal of the seismic program was to map previously unknown shallow faults in and around the city for hazard assessment and to assist in the post-earthquake recovery effort. Reflection seismic data were collected along six 2D lines, two of which were within the Christchurch metropolitan area and four were in rural areas west of the city. Recording conditions were challenging within the city, but good quality images were obtained along all of the seismic lines, with events interpretable to a depth of approximately 1.5 km. Numerous faults were imaged along the lines and these were interpreted in two groups - older faults that showed clear offsets in deep (> 1 km) reflections and younger faults that showed displacement in shallow reflections. Some faults in the latter group were interpreted to be directly associated with hypocentres of the earthquake and aftershocks. Don Lawton is a Professor of Geophysics and Chair in Exploration Geophysics in the Department of Geoscience at the University of Calgary. His research interests include acquisition, processing and interpretation of multicomponent seismic data, seismic anisotropy, integrated geophysical and geological studies in complex geological settings, and geological storage of CO2. He is an Associate Director of the Consortium for Research in Elastic Wave Exploration Seismology (CREWES) and is Theme Lead in Secure Carbon Storage for Carbon Management Canada, a Network of Centres of Excellence. In 2011 he led a team from the University of Calgary and CREWES to New Zealand for seismic imaging below the City of Christchurch following a devastating earthquake there. He is a past Editor of the Canadian Journal of Exploration Geophysics, and was a recipient of a Meritorious Service Award from the Canadian Society of Exploration Geophysicists (CSEG) in 1996 and the CSEG Medal in 2000. He is a member of SEG, AAPG, EAGE, CSEG, CSPG, ASEG, and APEGA.
Read Next Former Straitjacket Fits Guitarist Andrew Brough Has Passed Away July 6, 2016 1:50PM Inside Neil Young's Nature-Themed Opus After a divorce, he's back in L.A. with a new band and a new love. But he's still got plenty to be pissed off about. By Patrick Doyle You can hear him from the hallway. Neil Young is kicked back on a couch in the centre of his suite at New York's Carlyle Hotel one recent morning, stabbing away at the strings of his acoustic guitar. His wet hair is combed back and he's wearing a T-shirt that says "Earth," with jeans and sandals. He places his beat-up 1940s Martin – previous owner: Hank Williams – next to him on the couch. "Sit down, make yourself at home," he says. Just then, his Samsung phone rings; the ringtone is his own voice shouting "Hello?!" He picks up – a wrong number. "I'll just turn it off, that'll solve it." Young is in the middle of a quick New York trip, and, as is typical for him, his schedule is ever-shifting. He just decided to do a sketch on The Tonight Show, forcing his team to cancel several interviews today. In front of Young are lyrics to the comedy bit, a song called "Two Neil Youngs Sitting on a Tree Stump," sent to him by Jimmy Fallon. Young doesn't like singing his own name, so he's been tweaking the words with help from his manager, Elliot Roberts. "You're gonna get a credit on this one," Young says to Roberts with a smile. Roberts, 73, has worked with Young since the late Sixties, and the two still speak several times a day. "I've never seen him happier," Roberts says. That's a recent development, however. In the past few years, several of Young's close pals died, including longtime film collaborator Larry Johnson and guitarist Ben Keith – losses that Young took hard. Then, in 2014, he parted ways with Pegi Young, his wife of 36 years, and moved out of Broken Arrow Ranch, the property in Redwood City, California, he had since 1970. "I got a divorce, and I gave my wife the ranch," he says matter-of-factly. (His son Ben, who has cerebral palsy, still lives at the ranch: "All his support systems are there.") Agostino Fabio/GC Images/Getty Young is dating actress Daryl Hannah, who said a big hello as she stepped into the hotel elevator just now. The couple live in L.A., putting Young in the city "for the first time since Zuma." The move has allowed Young to reconnect with several old friends. "I was so remote for so long," he says. "All my old friends are now just a few miles away." One is Stephen Stills, who's been making music with Young lately. Stills and other friends, including Graham Nash and the members of Crazy Horse, celebrated Young's 70th birthday in November at L.A.'s Roxy. "Daryl put together a great party," Young says. "I felt really loved." Hannah has helped Young focus on his health, with an organic diet, regular Pilates and a lot of walking. "I like to listen to the animals," he says. "I like to track the beauty of what's going on. I enjoy being with the plants and stuff." Young aimed to capture that beauty on Earth, a new live album featuring his most environmentally conscious songs, from "After the Gold Rush" to tracks from last year's The Monsanto Years, on which he attacked the agrochemical giant as a jumping-off point to sound the alarm on the planet's decline. Young spent months enhancing Earth with animal and nature sounds – bees, roosters, crashing waves – that he recorded himself near his house. "There's a lot going on in the world that isn't all lovey-dovey and cool beach songs," he says. "I've done all of that." A week after Earth's release, Young put out a new version of Human Highway, a 1982 film comedy that he co-directed, about a nuclear disaster that ends the world. "I arrived in L.A. and joined Buffalo Springfield in 1966," Young continues. "Since then, we've lost 90 percent of the fish we eat from the ocean. There's only 10 percent of them left, and there's three times as many of us." He shakes his head. "It's math." Even for Young, the past decade has been full of left turns. He finally agreed to a Buffalo Springfield reunion tour in 2011, but canceled it after seven shows because he was disappointed with their playing, according to a representative for Young. He's ramped up his output, releasing theme albums like Fork in the Road, a love letter to his custom electric Lincoln Continental, and A Letter Home, cut in a 1947 recording booth at Third Man Records in Nashville. "This is the age where you should have freedom to do whatever you want and put it out." "They're much better players than I am," Young says of his Promise of the Real bandmates. Jay Blakesberg The only problem, according to Young, is getting that music heard. His music is not available on streaming services aside from Tidal, which supports high-quality audio. He spent several years developing his high-resolution Pono music player, which has struggled to catch on. "Technology has done a disservice to music," he says. "I think there's a place for rebel radio, with special receivers, where jocks play what they want: vinyl, new stuff, old stuff, and it's all analog. Because there's no variety. It's all, like, GMO music." But Young has plowed ahead anyway. "Just because everything else is broken doesn't mean I have to be broken," he says. On Earth, he's backed by Promise of the Real, a band featuring Willie Nelson's sons Lukas, 27, and Micah, 26. Young first played with them at Farm Aid in 2014, and they have been with him since. They usually join Young onstage after his acoustic set, and roadies in hazmat suits pretend to spray the stage with chemicals. "They have no fear," says Young, who loves the three-guitar attack he forms with the Nelsons. "They're much better players than I am. Lukas is like a gunslinger, and Micah is very ethereal and spaced. So they're completely different, and I'm somewhere in between." Where Crazy Horse attack Young's songs with a garage-y simplicity, Promise of the Real add virtuosity and youthful energy. They grew up on Young's songs (their band name is inspired by a lyric from "Walk On"), and they've learned more than 100 of them, playing three-hour sets including rarities like 1974's "Vampire Blues." "I've always wanted to do this, but no one has ever been able to follow it," Young says. Recording The Monsanto Years, Young and the band drank lots of Amazonian yerba maté tea and smoked homegrown pot in the studio. "He seems like he's 25," says Micah. "He gets deeper with age. And danker." After he wraps his current tour in October, Young will continue work on Archives II, the follow-up to 2009's Archives, which collected unreleased material up to 1972. Young says the project will include Dume, an album of songs from the Zuma era, and Hitchhiker, an acoustic LP from the mid-Seventies. The major holdup has been developing technology for presenting the ambitious project: "We're gonna have a website that's, like, 60 years of music in chronological order, with links so you can look at my archives and play the music off the high-res source at the same time." So what's it like to reflect on all he's accomplished over the years? "I don't," he says. "I need to take a break and go to the bathroom." In October, Young and Promise of the Real will play California's Desert Trip, with Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, the Who, the Rolling Stones and Roger Waters. "I was amazed that I was asked to be in it," Young says. But don't expect him to cater to the audience with a set full of hits. "I don't give a shit," he says. "I don't care what people want to hear – that's not why I'm playing. I'm not an entertainer in the classic sense. I play what I feel like playing, and I hope the people like it."

All US politicians should be pro-sex education in post-Roe world By Teresa Blackmon On Jul 2, 2022 I'm not here to take a stance on abortion. Debates are raging on both sides, but it doesn't change the fact our Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, and now millions of women in more than a dozen states who previously had access to abortion soon no longer will. Now that we've got here, the question is: how we can minimize the number of women who experience unwanted pregnancy in the first place — particularly in states where access to abortion is now restricted? It's a utilitarian question of harm reduction, and the glaring answer is sexual education. Although concrete statistics are difficult to come by, it is estimated that about half of women who get abortions are using no form of birth control whatsoever at the time of conception, and a further 41 percent are doing so inconsistently. This status quo — where birth control usage is lax and one in five pregnancies is terminated — needs to change. This past week the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade leaving the abortion issue to individual states. Erin Schaff/The New York Times via AP, Pool, File It's also an indictment of our education system. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, less than half of high schools and less than a fifth of middle schools cover the 20 recommended components of sexual education. And, according to surveys of students, the situation is only getting worse. The share of girls who say they received information about where to get birth control before they had sex for the first time has fallen from 87 percent to 64 percent since 1995. It shouldn't come as a surprise, then, that America experiences higher rates of teen pregnancy than most other developed nations. Comprehensive sexual education is associated with a lower risk of teen pregnancy — and lifelong empowerment to take control of one's reproductive destiny. America experiences higher rates of teen pregnancy than most other developed nations. Sexual education has been shown to lower these rates. Much of this comes down to state and local legislation. Today, only 30 states and the District of Columbia mandate sexual education, just 22 require that instruction be medically and factually accurate, and a mere 19 require that methods of contraception be covered at all. Ironically, many of the states now restricting access to abortion either don't require sexual education or stress abstinence in their instruction. That must change. More than half of American teens will engage in intercourse by the time they graduate. Human beings have sex, and pretending otherwise is foolish. Teaching them to do so responsibly is the only realistic path forward. Education must be used to change the status quo where one in five pregnancies are terminated. REUTERS/Shannon VanRaes Every single US lawmaker — and particularly every pro-life lawmaker — should be proposing bills to shore-up sexual education in schools. Empowering the post-Roe generation to engage in responsible sex is the least we can do, and legislators would find it's a vote winner, too. A whopping 89 percent of likely voters say sex education is important in middle school, and an overwhelming 98 percent think it's important in high school. Now that abortion is no longer legal in many states, we should encourage teenagers to avoid getting pregnant — by teaching them about contraception via sexual education in school. Meanwhile, American parents should also be demanding better reproductive education for their kids. In many areas, sexual education policy falls to local school boards. Just as hordes of concerned parents recently protested the politicization of their kid's curricula at school board meetings, they should call for comprehensive sexual education from their local officials now, too. The bottom line: sex education is more important than ever in a post-Roe world. We must empower the next generation of women with the knowledge to help them take charge of their reproductive freedom.

The University of Ibadan (UI) Vice Chancellor, Prof. Abel Idowu Olayinka has met with student leaders across the faculties on June 5, 2018 where he declared that he was not against student unionism, but he would not allow the students to overstay in school in the name of unionism while their mates in private universities graduate on record time. The student representatives including Hall Chairmen and Secretaries, Faculty Presidents as well as other interested students met with the ice chancellor at the Senate Chamber to raise various issues with the management as solutions and suggestions were proffered. The vice chancellor, who was meeting the broad spectrum of student representatives for the first time after the suspension of unionism, remarked that he had always wanted a forum where he could regularly get students' input into the running of the university. The vice chancellor explained the management's positions on some of the contentious issues when the forum became more lively as student representatives began to engaged him on various matters of interest including the restoration of student union. "I want you to convince me on what you are missing with the suspension of unionism by the Senate. Your primary reason of coming to this university is to get a degree. It is our responsibility to ensure that you achieve that goal and move on to become successful in life. I am not against unionism, but you will agree with me that this thing has been counterproductive." Prof. Olayinka said. "Do you know how much of time we have lost to needless crises occasioned by unionisms of various nature? I think we should reason over the one we have control over and be realistic. During Prof. Falase and Prof. Bamiro's tenure, student union was suspended for 10 years. I don't think those students who passed through UI during that period are inferior in any way! Please, let us think about how you can get your degree on time because I know that union Presidency is not a degree", he stated. Prof. Olayinka announced, on water and other municipal services that the university had hired a contractor to rehabilitate and dig more boreholes in order to ensure that water flows in all the hostels and toilets. A student from Queen Idia hall attested to the improved availability of light and water, therefore commending the Management for the relentless effort to ensure that the learning environment is conducive. The Vice Chancellor summoned the Director of Information Technology and Media Services (ITeMs), Mrs. Abiodun Alao who explained the issue of identity card that contrary to insinuation that the Cards were not smart ones, "the fact that the chips were not feasible didn't make the cards ordinary", adding that students will soon begin to see the functionality of the card when the second phase of the project is launched very soon. She stated that the money being paid for the identity card each session was for revalidation and not that the university was cheating the students by repeated payment for the same product. On the money being charged on unionism when the union has been suspended, the vice chancellor asked the Bursar to refund the money, urging the students to write to the student affairs on any matter of interest, just as he freely gave out his e-mail address and phone number to the students. The Dean of student affairs, Prof. Ajuwape in his own words also attested that the vice chancellor had approved purchase of various needs towards making water available all the time through water tankers. Present at the meeting are the Vice chancellor, Professor Idowu Olayinka, Deputy Vice Chancellor (academic), Prof. Adeyinka Aderinto, the Registrar, Mrs. Olubunmi Faluyi, University Bursar, Dr. Micheal Alatise, Dean of Student Affairs, Prof. A.T.P.

Heat oil in a pan and saute chicken for 2-3 minutes or until golden. Just brown the ingredients to seal off the flavours but don't cook completely - this is done in the oven. Add garlic, spring onions, corn and capsicum and cook for 2 minutes or until vegetables have heated through. Reduce heat and stir through the asparagus, then stir through remaining ingredients to coat well. Stir the sauce through the sauteed chicken and vegetables and allow to cool. Never add hot filling to raw pastry. Melt the butter over a medium heat and add the flour, stirring constantly. Gradually pour in the chicken stock stirring to avoid lumps. Continue stirring until a thickish sauce consistency is achieved. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl. Add the butter and rub through the flour until a breadcrumb appearance is reached. Add the cold water gradually and incorporate until a soft dough consistency is formed. Turn out and knead on a floured surface until smooth. Line a 22cm pie dish with half the prepared pastry. Trim the pastry around the edges of the tin. Add the pie filling, push down well and cover with remaining pastry (or you may prefer to use puff pastry for the top). Tuck edges into the side of pie tin to neatly seal the top. Brush with beaten egg, sprinkle with cornmeal and make 2-3 small cuts in top of pastry to allow steam to escape. Bake in preheated 190C oven for 30 minutes, or until pastry is cooked through and filling is hot. Serves 6.

Bananas are finicky creatures. Our experience in the Ross household is that bananas go from green to brown practically overnight. We received a banana holder for Christmas, which helps somewhat with the rapid bruising and over-ripening, but I still find myself with brown bananas by the end of each week. Does anyone else have this situation going on in their kitchen? Tired of baking the exact same banana bread week after week, I did some investigating and found these delicious recipes! 1. Mix the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a large bowl. 2. Mix the buttermilk, egg, butter and bananas in another bowl. 3. Mix the wet and dry ingredients making sure to not over mix. 4. Heat a pan and melt a touch of butter in it. We Santa Feans have been so blessed this season (knock on wood) to not have any fires in our area of the National Forest. We've had more rain and moisture this year than previous years, and the wilderness is so lush and green right now, with wild flowers in bloom and colorful, tiny butterflies fluttering about. I took Kua on a run up to Puerto Nambe yesterday, a clearing in the woods on the way to Santa Fe Baldy. It was such a beautiful day! I've been a little MIA lately. I just got back from a week-long vacation to the East Coast, where I soaked up some sun at Virginia Beach, laughed with my mom and sister over Sangria and Chardonnay, and read a whole stack of good books. I love the landscape, mountains, and (non-humid) weather in Santa Fe, but I yearn for water! It was so wonderful to spend a whole vacation enjoying the Atlantic Ocean, the Charles River and bays in Boston, and the Saco River in New Hampshire. My mom, sister and I enjoy paddle boarding in Rudee's Inlet. We tried some paddle board-style yoga, which is way more challenging than it looks! In Boston, my sister and I spent a morning at Walden Pond. It was so perfect! I recently re-read Thoreau's book, and it was amazing to see the real place. We visited the foundation of Thoreau's house, and enjoyed a run around the lake and swimming in the warm water. Happy Independence Day! I have many fond memories of 4th of Julys past -- watching fireworks from my deck, listening to the Mraz Bros band play music at Grand View Lodge, walking in parades with my cheerleading squad, running the local 5 mile race with my mom, and hanging out with my fellow drum corps friends after a full day of marching parades when I was in Blue Stars. Working in a hospital, 4th of July is just another Friday (although with a slightly higher rate of Trauma Stats), so I didn't get to golf and day drink like the rest of my household, but I am looking forward to grilling at a friend's house tonight!
Ares or Mars Statue Marble Finish MAY TAKE UP TO 8 BUSINESS DAYS TO SHIP. Ares, God of War Cold Cast Resin 12.25" High Ares was the god of war, and son of Zeus and Hera. He represented the raw violence and untamed acts that occured in wartime, in contrast to Athena, who was a symbol of tactical strategy and military planning. He was disliked by both his parents. Whenever Ares appeared in a myth, he was depicted as a violent personality, who faced humiliation through his defeats more than once. In the Iliad, it is mentioned that Zeus hated him more than anyone else; Ares was also on the losing side of the Trojan War, favouring the Trojans. He was the lover of his sister, Aphrodite, who was married to Hephaestus. When the latter found out about the affair, he devised a plan and managed to humiliate both of them. The union of Ares and Aphrodite resulted in the birth of eight children, including Eros, god of love. There were few temples attributed to Ares in Ancient Greece. Sacrifices would usually be made to him when an army would march to war; Spartans would make sacrifices to Enyalius, another lesser god and son of Ares and Enyo. However, the name was also used as a byname for Ares. When Ares went to war, he was followed by his companions, Deimos (terror) and Phobos (fear), who were the product of his union with Aphrodite. Eris, goddess of discord and sister of Deimos and Phobos, often accompanied them in war. Aris Is also called Mars, Ares.

On April 15, 2005, the Hagley Museum and Library will sponsor a symposium on utopian visions at world's fairs and international expositions. These mammoth festivals have been sites for many groups and individuals to present utopian perspectives on the modern world. Inventors, reformers, manufacturers, private associations, and governments have used the facilities and publicity of the fairs to present their responses to contemporary problems, promising new visions for human experience and expanded opportunities for enjoying life. We invite papers that discuss the use of material culture, especially technology and consumer goods, to exhibit and represent utopian visions, as well as proposals concerning ideas that were introduced at the fairs for promoting scientific, industrial and human development. Proposals may focus on any World's Fair held in North America, beginning with the Centennial Exposition of 1876. The symposium is being held in conjunction with an exhibition at Hagley on world's fairs and international expositions. Proposals are due by November 1, 2004 and should be sent to Dr. Roger Horowitz, Hagley Museum and Library, PO Box 3630, Wilmington DE 19807, email [email protected], fax 302-655-3188.

According to the American School Counselor Association (ASCA), one of the key components of a school counseling program is the delivery of structured lessons that are designed to provide all students with the knowledge, attitudes and skills appropriate for their developmental level. This school-based mental health program focuses on prevention through education by teaching students to identify symptoms of depression, suicidality, and self-injury in themselves and their peers. The curriculum is aimed to teach students that suicide is not a normal response to stress, but rather a preventable tragedy that often occurs as a result of untreated depression. View a video that teaches them to recognize signs of depression and suicide in themselves and others. Complete a screening tool to assess for signs of depression. The screening tool is not meant to be diagnostic but aimed to indicate the presence of symptoms consistent with depression. Learn an easy-to-remember acronym, ACT(Acknowledge, Care, Tell). Students are taught certain steps to take if they encounter a situation that requires help from a trusted adult.

Two killed, over 60 hurt as cops, protesters clash in Kotkapura Two men were killed and more than 60 injured in clashes between police and Sikh protesters in Kotkapura on Wednesday over the recent desecration of a 'bir' of Guru Granth Sahib. Sachin Sharma An injured policeman during the protests following desecration of a 'bir'.(Sanjeev Kumar/HT Photo) Later in the day, Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal ordered a judicial inquiry by a high court judge to probe the desecration incident and its aftermath, besides assuring Punjabis that exemplary punishment would be awarded to perpetrators of the "dastardly act". Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal announced Rs 1-crore reward to any person giving information leading to the arrest of those who committed the act of sacrilege. The protesters, led by fringe radical outfits, are demanding the arrest of those responsible for tearing off more than 100 pages of the Guru Granth Sahib at Bargari village, 15km from Kotkapura in Faridkot district, on Monday. These pages were torn allegedly from a 'bir' that was stolen from a nearby village, Burj Jawahar Singh Wala, in June. The protests come amid the uproar over the recent pardon granted by the Akal Takht to Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, with former Takht Damdama Sahib jathedar Balwant Singh Nandgarh suggesting the alleged involvement of dera followers in the desecration. The dera, however, has categorically denied any role in the incident and also condemned it. On Wednesday morning, police opened fire at protesters at Behbal Kalan village, 10km from Faridkot, in which Kishan Singh, 45, of nearby Niami Wala village and Gurjit Singh, 20, of nearby Sarawan village were killed. Earlier in the day, 62 persons, including 35 policemen, were injured in a bloody clash between cops and Sikh protesters in Kotkapura town. The police used lathis and water cannons to disperse protesters, even as the latter attacked cops with kirpans and torched police vehicles. The police were able to control the situation after the two-hour-long clash that also left Bathinda inspector general of police (IGP) Jitendra Jain injured. Stir spreads Starting from Bargari village on Monday, the protest has spread to Kotkapura, Moga and Faridkot in the past two days following mobilisation through audio and video messages on the social media and announcements in village gurdwaras. Several roads leading to Bathinda and Faridkot have been blocked by protesters who are sitting on roads outside villages. On Tuesday, a violent clash between cops and protesters at Buttar Kalan village in Moga district had left 19 people injured. The Sant Samaj has called for a bandh in Malwa districts (Faridkot, Moga, Fazilka, Ferozepur, Muktsar, Bathinda and Barnala) on Thursday over the desecration and its fallout. "The desecration of Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji is a deep-rooted conspiracy aimed at inciting communal tension and destabilising the hard-won peace in Punjab. I humbly urge all of you to maintain restraint in this hour of crisis." - Parkash Singh Badal, Punjab chief minister "CM Parkash Singh Badal has virtually lost control over things and the state is drifting towards anarchy. Badal should better quit if he is not able to maintain control over things." -Capt Amarinder Singh, Congress deputy leader in LS "The situation at Kotkapura was not handled in a professional manner by the police. There was no need for using force to disperse people who were protesting in a peaceful manner." -Giani Gurbachan Singh, Akal Takht jathedar "We strongly condemn the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib. Those who have done it are sinners of the highest order." -Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, Dera Sacha Sauda chief

David Marc by Sestini & Corti, Rome – Italy SGS offices by Johnson Chou, Toronto – Canada Moncler collections at Milan Fashion Week, Milan – Italy Simone Rocha and Craig Green were among designers tasked with redesigning Moncler's signature down jacket for its new Genius project, launched at this year's Milan Fashion Week. On the opening night of the city's fashion week, 20 February 2018, the clothing brand Moncler invited visitors to a huge Milanese hangar. Rooms inside were each dedicated to one of eight collections making up the Moncler's Genius initiative, which is described by the brand as a "hub of exceptional minds operating in unison while simultaneously cultivating their singularity". Moncler tasked each of the eight collaborators, which included London-based designers Simone Rocha and Craig Green, with reinterpreting its down jacket. They were instructed to keep its function in mind, ensuring that the design would still perform as a warm coat. "Each project has the classic Moncler down jacket as the main playground, stands on its own, and all of them unanimously converging on the item," said the brand. "Keeping function at the core and approaching the duvet as an object, unique experiments ensue." Each collaboration came with a corresponding number and mission statement. The first collection, named Moncler 1, saw Valentino creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli design with the "pure essence" of Moncler in mind. Doing so, he stripped back the duvet jacket – creating minimal garments in elongated silhouettes, which he based on his previous couture collections. Moncler 2 looked to the brand's heritage. Described as a "homage to its year of birth", the Moncler 1952 garments are based on the brand's classic designs – but in bold colours with enlarged logos. Moncler 3 was based on Grenoble – a city at the front of the French Alps where Moncler began. While made from mix-and-match printed fabrics, the coats are designed as technical wear for mountain climbing and trekking. To create the fourth collection, Moncler teamed up with fashion designer Simone Rocha, who created voluminous silhouettes based on photographs of Victorian climbers in petticoats. Menswear designer Craig Green was behind Moncler 5. The designer aimed to abstract the body through his collection, which he created in monochrome fabrics. Black fabric was also used exclusively by designer Kei Ninomiya, who transformed the brand's down jacket into a series of modular elements to create Moncler 6. Hiroshi Fujiwara's Moncler 7 looked to streetwear subcultures, while Los Angeles label Palm Angels emblazoned Moncler 8 with bold lettering. By creating these eight diffusion collections, Moncler hopes to better-appeal to the "uniqueness of the consumer". "Letting creativity run riot strengthens the uniqueness of Moncler," said the brand. "It allows the product to speak by itself as it takes different shapes according to the concept of each project." "The uniqueness of all the projects mirrors the uniqueness of the consumers." https://www.dezeen.com/2018/02/22/moncler-genius-project-craig-green-simone-rocha-milan-fashion-week/ TAGS: brand | collections | exhibit | fashion design | garments | Milan Fashion Week GAD office by Roman Zitnansky architecture + GutGut by retail design blog Mazzo by Concrete Architectural Associates by retail design blog SpinosCoffee Micro Roastery by AndreasPetropoulos, Kalamata – Greece by retail design blog Virgin Active lighting by Hoare Lea Lighting, London – UK by retail design blog

College Board President and CEO David Coleman and "Bloomberg EDU" Host and Executive Producer Jane Stoddard Williams at the 2014 Aspen Ideas Festival. When it comes to the state of student testing in the US, College Board President and CEO David Coleman said, "We are building an iron wall of inequality today into the next century." At the 2014 Aspen Ideas Festival, Coleman, whose organization develops and administers standardized tests, such as the SAT, PSAT, and Advanced Placement exams, is also the architect of the hotly debated Common Core. He discussed testing students as a measure of college preparedness, the issues of inequality and discrimination in the classroom, and the state of the US public education system. Read below for highlights from Coleman's conversation with "Bloomberg EDU" Host and Executive Producer Jane Stoddard Williams. In the clip above, Coleman explains how he's addressing criticisms that high-priced college test prep courses lead to unfair test results for those who cannot afford it. "People who defend assessment always like to say it finds diamonds in the rough, but guess what, it doesn't alone," he said. "When we worry, perhaps rightly, that assessment can discriminate, let's remember that there's another thing that we know ... that can discriminate more, which is adults," he said. In the clip above, Coleman describes an example of what happened when one school district stopped relying on teacher recommendations for determining which students would take Advanced Placement (AP) courses and exams, and instead relied on high PSAT data.

You are here: Home › Talk of AutoZone Park sale premature: Pontius Talk of AutoZone Park sale premature: Pontius By Kevin Reichard on March 21, 2012 in Minor-League Baseball, News Talk of selling AutoZone Park to the city of Memphis was premature, as the Memphis Redbirds Baseball Foundation is exploring several liquidation options, according to treasurer John Pontius. Two weeks ago the news broke that the city was reviewing a proposal to buy the home of the Memphis Redbirds (Class AAA; Pacific Coast League). Pontuis says that while accurate, the account was a little premature: a sale of the ballpark to the city is but one of several scenarios being considered by the foundation and its lenders. One alternative scenario: that both the ballpark and the team will be sold to the same buyer. From Memphis Flyer: There's always been a desire — both from the foundation's standpoint and the city's — to make sure we concluded the final chapter of the Redbirds' financial story that gave it new, positive, long-term life for the city. That's what we've been working on for a few years. We're closer to a conclusion, a recapitalization, a sale, or something that repositions the Redbirds for a prosperous future in Memphis. But it's premature to speculate on which of those options will come about, and when…. There are two primary assets of the Redbirds Foundation. They could be sold separately or together, and it really depends on the buyer. Would a franchise owner want to own the ballpark too, or be a tenant in the ballpark? We're deep in the throes of understanding the options, but we're not [at a point of sale] yet. The challenge, he added, was to put together a deal that satisfies a potential buyer and the holder of the foundation bonds: no doubt investor Fundamental Advisors would need to take a haircut on any deal, so the real issue may be how close a haircut. However, that's the risk that the likes of a Fundamental Advisors — which specializes in distressed properties — takes.

A confidential report releaed by WikiLeaks into the dumping of toxic waste along the Ivory Coast, has seen an extraordinary gag order served on the UK media. The order gags the press from reporting a parliamentry question and answer. In effect, the communication between parliament and the people has been muzzled. The Ivory Coast dumping mentioned, by multi-national oil and commodities trader Trafigura, is possibly the most culpable environmental disaster since thousands were killed in the Bhopal chemical spill. What this gags order aims at is preventing the mention of Trafigura and Minton in the same context. The Minton report was released by WikiLeaks on September 14, 2009. Despite this and some rock solid work by Guardian investigations editor David Leigh and other journalists on the boader Trafigura contamination, the Minton report released by WikiLeaks was not named in the UK press, nor were its contents report. Why? Because of the earlier secret 11 September 2009 media injuction against the report, as referred to by Paul Farrelly MP. To-date the UK public has been kept in the dark about the Minton report and its contents. Paul Farrelly's question is an attempt to take on the suppression issue. In the process it connected the Minton report on WikiLeaks to Trafigura, something the UK media has been secretly ordered not to do. Statements made in parliament, including those of Paul Farrelly MP, traditionally enjoy an absolute exemption from molestation by the regular judiciary. Parliament does not, insomuch as it believes itself to be an expression of the national will, subordinate itself to any other court. Knowing this, lawyers for Trafigura, Carter-Ruck, told the Guardian that the order covered reporting of Paul Farrelly MP's questions. That Carter Ruck felt this claim was makable is a bold and dangerous move towards the total privatization of censorship. Is a multi-billion pound commodities trader a truer expression of the national will than the House of Commons? The question is no longer rhetorical. The Commons' gag and the September 11 gag are not the only issues. The London Independent has removed from its site, without explanation, its September 17 investigative article on the issue "Toxic shame: Thousands injured in African city". As for other papers, no one has any idea, because it is the habit now in the UK to secretly remove articles from newspaper archives and their indexes.

Nonapoptotic forms of cell death may facilitate the selective elimination of some tumor cells or be activated in specific pathological states. The oncogenic RAS-selective lethal small molecule erastin triggers a unique iron-dependent form of nonapoptotic cell death that we term ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is dependent upon intracellular iron, but not other metals, and is morphologically, biochemically, and genetically distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. We identify the small molecule ferrostatin-1 as a potent inhibitor of ferroptosis in cancer cells and glutamate-induced cell death in organotypic rat brain slices, suggesting similarities between these two processes. Indeed, erastin, like glutamate, inhibits cystine uptake by the cystine/glutamate antiporter (system x(c)(-)), creating a void in the antioxidant defenses of the cell and ultimately leading to iron-dependent, oxidative death. Thus, activation of ferroptosis results in the nonapoptotic destruction of certain cancer cells, whereas inhibition of this process may protect organisms from neurodegeneration.

He and his group of buddies are really cool in this game. They helped me out a lot and now I can play Gears pretty well. They also go out of their way to make sure the teams are fair and even, matching skills that is. I had the most fun chilling with them on Gears than any other time. It would be cool if we could all go join up with them. Yeah, Hero I have a blast just watching him play. Next time you play chainsaw tripple as much as you can, he really hates it lol. I can't believe I'm finally having fun on here.

Home/Digital Humanities The digital humanities at Stanford sit at the crossroads of computer science and the humanities. Since the 1980's, a wide range of computational tools have enabled humanities scholars to conduct research at a scale once thought impossible. Digital humanities foster collaboration and traverse disciplines and methodological orientations, with projects to digitize archival materials for posterity, to map the exchange and transmission of ideas in history, and to study the evolution of common words over the centuries. At Stanford, current digital humanities projects implement tools such as 3-D mapping, algorithmic literary analysis, advanced visualization techniques, and digitization of textual corpora in non-Latin languages. Researchers experiment and interact with source materials in ways that yield new findings, while also building community and sharing information. Stanford scholars harness new technologies through an array of digital humanities initiatives: Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) CESTA is an internationally renowned digital humanities center located in Wallenberg Hall on Stanford's campus. There, humanities scholars collaborate with qualified professional staff in an open research space that brings together interdisciplinary research teams made up of seasoned researchers, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars who collaborate on projects with the necessary software and hardware tools. CESTA also offers opportunities for fellows and affiliates of the Stanford Humanities Center to pursue digital humanities projects, to participate in workshops and training sessions, and to publish the results of their work online. Go to the CESTA Lab The Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research (CIDR) CIDR is a team of humanists and social scientists within Stanford University Libraries who promote digital scholarship by developing new tools and methods and integrating technology and information resources. Their expertise in data discovery, data creation, data management, and analytical tools supports the generation and dissemination of new knowledge. CIDR enables digital research and teaching to encourage and inspire innovative scholarship throughout the University. Go to CIDR The Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) CCRMA is a multi-disciplinary facility housed on Stanford's campus in the Knoll where composers and researchers work together using computer-based technology both as an artistic medium and as a research tool. CCRMA collaborates across such disciplines as music, electrical engineering, computer science, art, and drama. The center offers academic courses, seminars, small interest group meetings, summer workshops, and colloquia. Concerts featuring computer-generated music also occur several times each year. Go to CCRMA The Digital Humanities Focal Group (DHFG) Part of Stanford's Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages (DLCL), DHFG promotes digital research on underrepresented literatures and cultures to counteract the English-language dominance of much work in the field. Through lectures, workshops, curriculum, and the development of digital humanities research projects, DHFG promotes faculty and graduate research in the digital humanities— especially those eligible for grant-funded opportunities. Faculty and graduate students share work in progress, discuss the state of the field, and identify important research that should be shared within the DLCL and related academic communities.

Project Bravo. New 109meter long superyacht from Oceano. Oceanco's 109m/357ft 'Project Bravo' was launched on 17 November 2018. Bravo is a prime example of Oceanco's new wave of forward-thinking yachts. With her naval architecture by Lateral Naval Architects, exterior design and layout by Nuvolari Lenard and interior by Reymond Langton Design, Bravo is unlike any preceding Oceanco. She is the first Oceanco to utilize its innovative LIFE (Lengthened, Innovative, Fuel-efficient, Eco-friendly) design. LIFE revolves around intelligent naval architecture that leverages a number of fundamental principles, which create a harmonious balance between weight, power, technical areas and luxury interior on board. James Roy, director of Lateral Naval Architects comments, "The LIFE design's use of advanced hybrid propulsion incorporating significant battery capability, combined with a single tier engine room allows novel use of space to deliver areas of outstanding luxury accommodation." Bravo embodies Oceanco's expertise in building large complex yachts, whereby project management proficiency played an integral part in Bravo's success. "A bespoke project of such magnitude and splendor will always present interesting challenges and opportunities" says owner's representative, Burgess. "With Project Bravo we created a truly spectacular yacht whose excellence is a clear reflection of the commitment of a dynamic and professional project team." After the innovations introduced with "Alfa Nero", Oceanco asked us to "raise the bar" and create another remarkable and revolutionary design, says Dan Lenard, senior partner of Nuvolari-Lenard. "Our approach with Bravo was to maintain a stunningly sleek profile without sacrificing any interior space. This new exterior style concept is bound to create a new design stream. It is important to us that we started this new stream together with Oceanco" The yacht's elegant contemporary interior compliments the exterior design. Pascale Reymond, partner in Reymond Langton Design, says, "We worked with artisans and craftsmen to create bespoke artworks, fabrics and signature furniture pieces that all combine to create a warm, inviting environment on board for the Owner's family and guests." Bravo pushes the limits within the world of superyachts to a new level!

Teaching children to be mindful of the waste they create is one of the first steps in developing environmental values and behaviours for future sustainability. This week, Cleanaway's kNOw Waste™ Education Program was delivered to local children by Cleanaway in partnership with Moree Plains Shire Council. Students from Gwydir Day Care and Preschool, Aussie Kids Moree, Moree Christian School, and Boggabilla Central School participated in the BinWise workshop within the kNOw Waste Education Program. Council's Acting Waste Manager Tahra Sayers explained kNOw waste™ Education Program is aimed at teaching children about sustainable waste management practices and encouraging them share this knowledge at home. "We hope children who participated in the program will share their learning experiences with their family, relatives and friends, and together we can ensure a cleaner, greener environment for us and future generations," said Mrs Sayers. The kNOw Waste™ Education Program supports key learning outcomes in science and technology and Human Society and its Environment. Further kNOw waste™ sessions have been scheduled for June during Storytime at the Moree Community Library and Mungindi Library. It also demonstrates Council's commitment to reduce the amount of waste going into landfills by helping the community to recycle papers, plastics and metals, problem wastes, and in general, help individuals lead a more sustainable lifestyle.

Regardless of your income level or economic standing purchasing a house is a pretty big deal. You're likely going to spend more money on the house than you would even think about splurging on another item because you're hoping that you're making an investment that will pay off both now and in the future. Although you have probably already contracted with a real estate agent and are being assisted throughout the home buying process, you also need to think about the legal aspect of the deal. Hiring a real estate attorney can be highly beneficial, and the following information will help you see why it is an essential move that you need to look into. If you buy a house without conducting a title check, you could be signing up for much more than just a piece of property. The importance of having a clean title simply cannot be stressed enough. Failing to do your due diligence in regards to this critical piece of the property buying puzzle might just turn out to be one of the biggest mistakes you've ever made. You just never know if there are possibly one or more liens against the title of the house that you are looking to purchase. Liens can come from so many different parties, including contractors who may have done work on the house and were never paid or even debtors who were granted a judgment against the former homeowners because of an unpaid debt. Once you sign for the house and take ownership of it any liens on the title could also then become your responsibility. That's why it is so vital for you to hire a real estate attorney before you purchase a piece of property. Let them perform a thorough check against the title of the house you want to make sure it's clean. It's also helpful to hire a lawyer because they understand how to decipher contracts. There's no reason for you waste time trying to figure out the legalese that can be found in some of the more complex real estate contracts. Your attorney will be right there to break it all down for you. Working with a real estate attorney makes buying a house so much easier. Reach out to one of these lawyers and get them on your realty case right away.
Teacher denies sex with schoolboy, claiming she is too short for the sex position By Dorothy G. Bender Last updated Dec 3, 2021 Kandice Barber, 35, is accused of sexual activity with a student (Photo: Hyde News & Pictures Ltd / PA) A married teacher claims that she could not have had sex with a student because she is too short for the position in question. Kandice Barber, 35, is accused of committing a sexual act on the unnamed 15-year-old boy and having sex with him while standing. Amersham court heard she was previously convicted in a trial in September last year for sending a video to the boy, showing her pleasuring herself while on a bed surrounded by toys sexual intercourse and sexually communicating with the complainant. The complainant, who is now 18, appeared via video link, claims he also met Barber for sexual activity on three occasions. Nadia Chbat, defending Barber, asked him about an alleged sexual incident while he was standing: "You accept that she is quite short, she is only about five feet, right? So you were taller than her back then, were you? You didn't even think she could reach your shoulders back then, did you? During re-examination by prosecutor Richard Milne, the boy said he had "crouched down" and bent his knees to get around the height difference. Kandice Barber denies the offenses (Photo: Hyde News & Pictures Ltd) The boy couldn't name the specific dates when the sexual activity took place, but he said it was from October 11, 2018 and just before mid-term, with two of the meetings he did. said it took place before and after her 16th birthday. On one occasion, he said that Barber drove them to the side of a busy main road and parked so the boy could do a sex act on him, before they got out of the car and she gave him a blowjob in a wooded area while he was lying down. on the ground. The court heard that before informing its principal of the allegations, the schoolboy threatened to "ruin" the teacher's life if he could not reconnect with her, promising that she would lose her family. Ms Chbat, cross-examining the boy, said: "You, I suggest, had become obsessed with Mrs Barber, haven't you? You, I suggest, wanted more contact with her again. "The threat, I suggest, is 'If you don't talk to me, watch what happens, you will lose your job and your family.' "The phone calls of March 10, 2018, I suggest, are you and her arguing on the phone. She would tell you to leave her alone and you would talk to each other and threaten to tell the police about your communication. She hung up on you. "I suggest the communication was threatening, that if she didn't get back in touch with you, you would ruin her life," the defense lawyer said. Ms Chbat added that her client said that no sexual activity had taken place and that it was all lies, which the complainant denied via the video link. Barber, from Wendover in Buckinghamshire, denies three counts of causing or instigating a child under 16 to engage in sex.

Jenkem Magazine PEOPLE THAT PISS ME OFF: THE "CONCERNED CITIZEN" July 31, 2011 / Bink Seavey / ARTICLES My former neighbor is a concerned citizen; typically, a middle aged, middle class–male or female–white person with a slew of insecurities stemming from an unfulfilling existence brought about by a succession of poor decisions. Or perhaps a micro penis. The concerned citizen has no shame, and will stop at nothing to assure the masses, or at least, the neighborhood that they're concerned with what everyone else is doing. "Get off my property!", "I'm calling the cops!", "My taxes paid for this damn park!" are the common phrases in the concerned citizen's vocabulary, but they can be hard to spot since they come in all varieties. There are several types of concerned citizens, like the guy who could have been the star quarterback, but he drank a little too much one night and raw romped his ex, Cathy the catholic pin cushion, who shat out an eighteen year investment with a ROI of "fuck you, I can do whatever I want." Twenty or so years down the road, he's separated from his wife, living in a shit hole off of MLK Blvd. and managing Barry's Burger Joint when he's not drunk on MD 20/20 and lathering his dysfunctional wet noodle. He's a "Get off my property!" concerned citizen. Then there are the typical old hags, like Cathy, who married her high school sweetheart after he knocked her up. She quickly settled into a life of underachievement in Middle America and started making babies. Cathy pooped out four more turds for offspring, before realizing the only thing her husband was good for is a pay check and load of life every now and again. So she kicked him out of his own house, but since she's a woman of faith, refuses to officially divorce him. Her hobbies include mixing her children's prescriptions with various boxed wines, and yelling, "I'm calling the cops!" at other people's children. Regardless of the roads they take, all concerned citizens arrive at the same intersection, of insanity and idiocy. They are driven by self-interest and a deluded sense of what the world should be, fueled by their own insecurities and short comings. They're not afraid to share these ideas in lame and despicable ways, like calling the cops on five year olds for pissing where humans have pissed for centuries, or yelling at anyone who seems to be enjoying their day. No booze in the park. No skating on sidewalks. No loud music. No late shows. No fun. And reasoning with these people is out of the question. The brain of the concerned citizen operates in mysterious ways, often acting on impulses before they're processed in the pre-frontal cortex–the simulator of the brain. These defective balls of grey matter aren't hard-wired for bargaining, logical thinking, or, really, much thinking outside personal gratification. And, unfortunately, they turn perfectly able bodies into little more than restless chimpanzees. Restless chimpanzees with cars, houses, boats and firearms. It's best to avoid confrontations with the concerned citizen, but if must indulge yourself, heckle from a safe distance and leave as soon as you see a cell phone. Maybe you can piss in their bushes later, but for now, go home, sit your ass down and bitch about it on the internet. The police will be on their way shortly.

metalock ☰Home Timeline Branches Tags Tickets Wiki Summary | Source | Releases | Screenshots | Rationale | Limitations | Author Metalock is an enhanced screen locker for the X11 windowing system. It is best described as similar to the program slock, (and in fact, it is based on it) except that it has background image support, and several other features. It is designed to be used with a background screen daemon, such as xidle. It is written in C, and is distributed under the terms of the MIT License. Why write another screen locker, when xscreensaver already exists? I don't like the lock dialog in that program! (I don't like flat colors/like images, and there were some missing features in that program) Additionally, it is a very large program with complex code. I have been frustrated with the visual limitations of the xscreensaver lock dialog for over a decade, in fact. I simply decided one weekend in early 2012 to address the problem, and it turned out to be trivial to write a similar program starting from the very simple and didactic code of slock. Such is the world of open source / free software, where many issues are resolved immediately, but there is always something that never gets fixed, no matter how many users dislike the status quo. The author of xscreensaver presents a compelling argument which emphasizes his priority of security/reliability over toolkit support. I agree with the vast majority of what he says, except that I disagree on the importance of the lock dialog appearance. Since it is something that I see fairly often, I would like to have a lock dialog that is visually pleasing. I believe that with a little work, metalock can be brought to that standard of reliability without being hideously ugly. Metalock is a very small program, and is unlikely to get particularly large in the near future. Current features include: Support for pixmap (image) xpm background and login box. It gives visual feedback as you type the password (Shows username and * for each character of password typed.) Bind arbitrary commands to key combinations (allows tasks such as pause/un-pause music without unlocking the screen) Optional XFT support for anti-aliased fonts. (This is optional in case greater security is desired) Optional Imlib2 support for use of png or jpg formats, which are more appropriate for photos or high-color images than xpm. In the future, there will also be an accompanying daemon called metaidle, (similar to xidle, except with more features) to match some of the features available in xscreensaver which metalock does not address.

Can visit my blog for more information on my experiences.. Wow! You really look prettier after the DEL surgery! Congrats! Your friends must have said so too? Was any of them not able to recognise you? How much did you pay for the surgery + medicine etc? Thanks babyangel11! They are able to recognise me and but all said that i look very different due to my bigger eyes. Right now, i cannot wait to start on the application of scar removal cream to reduce the appearance of the mini scar on my eyelids.. Wow! The rates are cheap n good results too! How long is the mini scar on your eyelid? It should be very short, right? The scar is about 0.5cm.. I can easily cover it with concealer so not really visible.. Dr Chen told me that after one month, swelling will go down by 70-80%... Now it's a month post surgery and the swelling has gone by down 80%.. I can start using the scar removal cream tonight.. Once swelling goes down totally, crease will decrease in height too.. Many people who don't know me cannot tell that i went for surgery.. hahaha.. hi everybody. i am noe in taiwan and i did my rhino with dr kao ytd. The operation was done in less than two hours. I shaved a bump n got a tip plasty. after i was wheeled out i rest for abt 30min nmake my way to ng ning to res.my nose kept bleeding n while i was slpingwith my head elevated blood was flowing down..my nose looks very swollen n tall now..waiting for the swelling to subside. Thanks for sharing trilogytwist! Wishing you the best in the recovery stages! As soon as you can, if you would, please tell us about your experience and interactions with Dr. Kao and if you could please share some b/a photos!! Oh Dear,hope u will have a speedy recovery, do monitor bleeding.. Sec day should be much better.All the best to ur result ya! trilogytwist wrote: hi everybody. i am noe in taiwan and i did my rhino with dr kao ytd. thank u all for the well wishes. my bleeding today is minimal and my gauze and splint is full of blood n my dried blood in my nose as well. i do not dare to clean my nose as today is only the second day. Nose feels super stuffy. i am flying off next Friday and i hope i can deswell until i am able to face the public! Will you be sharing some pics in a few days? am notbsure whether i will be comfortable sharing picture of my nose. till now i am beginning to regret gg for this surgery.maybe because i am alone and looking in the mirror is depressing. wondering why did i go thru all this....zzzz. Did my surgery on friday night and gg for a follow up with dr kao on tue.at tri hospital.. cannot even think of stepping out my room nt to say gg all the way to another hospital. my nose is all bloody n i havr no instruction on hw to clean my nose!!! trilogytwist wrote: am notbsure whether i will be comfortable sharing picture of my nose. although I've never done rhinoplasty before, cant give u advice on how to take care of your nose, I did p.s alone before and I understand how you are feeling. Please relax, calm down, and dont keep looking at the mirror. You may be alone at the moment but your friends and family are all waiting for you back in Singapore. Watch tv, read magazines whatever..just keep yourself occupied. Keep telling yourself it will all be fine. Felt exactly the same too. I was scared and worried the first few weeks after my nose surgery. which surgeon did you go to? And what procedures did you do? but can you tell us in detail about your experience with dr kao? 5 days passed. How's your recovery progress? I'm planning to have my eyelids and nose surgery done in Taiwan. Problem is, I'm considering 2 different doctors at the same time.
A vulnerable 89-year-old man has been targeted by bogus callers who made off with £500 of his cash. Police are appealing for witnesses after the incident at a house in Colley End Park in Paignton after the victim returned home from shopping at around 11am on Wednesday August 16. DC Dixie Dean said: "Two unknown men called at the door of the victim ten minutes after he had returned home from being out shopping. "The men advised that they believed he had a roof leak as they had been working at a neighbouring property when they spotted the leak and that a roof tile may have slipped onto the victim's roof blocking the gutter causing the water to back up into his bathroom. "One of the men took the victim up to his bathroom and left him there whilst they went out into his back garden in order to look up at his roof. After about ten minutes the victim realised that the two men had not made their way into his back garden and made his way downstairs to his front lounge and noticed that £500 cash had been taken from his wallet on the coffee table. "The two men are described as white, in their mid-20s with short dark hair. One man was of a larger build with a tanned complexion. The other man was wearing a white top which had some wording in bold letters on the reverse with the word 'Valley' on it. "No vehicles were seen and the victim's neighbours had not had any builders working for them. We believe the suspects specifically targeted the victim after spotting him walking home and followed him either on foot or in a vehicle. Zoo breeds its first ever BLUE frog!

Various connectors have been used for smaller devices such as PDAs, mobile phones or digital cameras. These include the now-deprecated (but standardized) Mini-A and the currently standard Mini-B, Micro-A, and Micro-B connectors. The Mini-A and Mini-B plugs are approximately 3 by 7 mm. The micro-USB plugs have a similar width but approximately half the thickness, enabling their integration into thinner portable devices. The micro-A connector is 6.85 by 1.8 mm with a maximum overmold size of 11.7 by 8.5 mm. The micro-B connector is 6.85 by 1.8 mm with a maximum overmold size of 10.6 by 8.5 mm. The Micro-USB connector was announced by the USB-IF on January 4, 2007. The Mini-A connector and the Mini-AB receptacle connector were deprecated on May 23, 2007. As of February 2009, many currently available devices and cables still use Mini plugs, but the newer Micro connectors are being widely adopted and as of December 2010, the Micro connectors are the most widely used. The thinner micro connectors are intended to replace the Mini plugs in new devices including smartphones and personal digital assistants. The Micro plug design is rated for at least 10,000 connect-disconnect cycles which is significantly more than the Mini plug design. The Universal Serial Bus Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification details the mechanical characteristics of Micro-A plugs, Micro-AB receptacles, and Micro-B plugs and receptacles, along with a Standard-A receptacle to Micro-A plug adapter. The cellular phone carrier group, Open Mobile Terminal Platform (OMTP) in 2007 have endorsed Micro-USB as the standard connector for data and power on mobile devices. These include various types of battery chargers, allowing Micro-USB to be the single external cable link needed by some devices.

News: Marine Fenders Evaluation of Wave Disturbance Study Results The design of a port is primarily aimed to provide suitable berthing conditions for the ships. Each ship or craft, depending on its size and Planning Study for the new cargo port in Naxos Island - Conceptual Design CNWAY and its Associates have successfully completed the Planning Study for the new Cargo Port in Naxos Island as well as the Conceptual Design of Small Port Facilities in Karystos - Evia Island CNWAY and its Associates have successfully completed the study of a small port in Karystos of Evia Island on behalf of the firm "Blue Farm Marine Fenders provide the necessary interface between the berthing ship and the berth structure and therefore the principal function of the fender is to transform the impact load from the berthing ship into reactions, which both the ship and berth structure can safely sustain (Carl A. Thoressen). Photo1: Pneumatic marine fenders in use for cruise ship berthing at Rhodes cruise terminal (Rhodes Island - 2012) Marine fenders typically operate as a group of single units where the type, location and density of their installation or deployment depends on several factors including their technical specifications, berth structure, ship type, etc. (see Photo 1). The basic function of the marine fenders is to manage the excess kinetic energy of the ship during the approach or berthing operation preventing damage to occur in both the ship and the berth. In case of elastomeric fenders the excess kinetic energy is stored within the elastic elements, which are deformed by developing a counter parallel (to the motion of the ship) reaction force, which results in slowing down the vessel and keeping it to a safe distance from the quay. The effectiveness of the fender system depends on the following three basic parameters: The correct system design (selection of suitable fender types and optimum arrangement), System operation according to the manufacture specifications, Regular inspection and system maintenance. The fendering system design is a specialized study which is sometimes omitted or incorrectly performed with the result that money is wasted for the supply of systems which are often unsuitable for the intended use (See photos 2.3 and 4). Photo 2. V type fender system (Buckling type) with contact plate which does not correspond to the intended needs of the berthed vessel, resulting in the need to suspend used vehicle tires on the contact plate to reduce system rigidity (Port of Sοuda, Adrias Pier – Crete Island - 2011) Photo 3. As above Photo 4. Improper selection and installation of fender type resulting in an inefficient operation of the system and the failure of its anchoring (Port of Poros Island - 2014) Photo 5. Installation of two different V- type fenders in short distance with different technical specifications and controversial operation efficiency (Port of Rhodes Island - 2012) The successful design of a fender system should follow the following basic steps (PIANC 2002): Determination of system requirements, Determination of operating characteristics, Assessment of the berth type where the system will be installed, Assessment of design parameters, Calculation of impact energy which will be received by the fender system (either during berthing or loading and unloading operations), Appropriate system selection, according to the total energy absorption requirements and system design criteria, Assessment of the reaction force and the associated frictional forces between fender and vessel, Berthing vessel resistance capacity check to reaction force generated by the selected fender system. The correct calculation of the design impact energy is particularly important because the selection of a suitable fender system will be based on that, while generally the principle «the Bigger the Better» does not apply. In fact the fender which has greater energy absorption than that required considering the design ship and the conditions of impact is more rigid developing greater reaction force and exerting inevitably greater pressure on the contact surface with the ship. These fenders require the application of a "larger impact force" to operate which may ultimately cause permanent deformation to the ships metal surfaces if the reaction force is greater than that of metal surface strength. Therefore, instead the impact energy being absorbed and converted to manageable reaction force solely by the fenders, in the case of a "harder" fender that greater force will deform the metallic surface of the vessel as well, causing damage to it. On the other hand the under sizing of a fender system will cause its failure with adverse consequences to the berth and the vessel. In many Greek ports improvised questionable quality and efficiency fender systems are used (see fig. 6 and 7) without specifications. In photo 7 a fender system made by used rubber tires can be seen suspended from a quay wall that has experienced damage from its insufficient operation. Photo 6. Suspended used rubber track tires as marine fenders in a quay wall (Port of Naxos Island - 2010) Photo 7. Old tires of vehicles with a chain suspended from a vertical quay wall that has experienced damage from its insufficient operation (Port of Souda, Crete Island - 2011) Finally, equally important is the annual inspection of the fender system for damage. The inspection should be performed by experienced engineers so as to maintain the system in working condition and within the design specifications. In order to prolong the useful life of a system, any damage must be repaired according to product specifications and without altering its functional characteristics. Photo 8. In the photo is shown a V type fender with contact panel and shear chains with failed anchor system after ship collision (Port of Souda, Crete Island- 2011) Marine fenders are considered standard equipment for a berth and their effective operation can prevent significant damage to ships and infrastructure. The maintenance cost savings for a marine facility equipped with a well-functioning fendering system is significant and exceeds the purchase, installation and maintenance cost, provided of course that the system design is supported by a comprehensive study.

Our team of certified computer repair technicians will implement an affordable computer security solution for your business. Businesses need to secure their data in Newbury Park, Thousand Oaks, Westlake Village, and Agoura Hills. You and your clients personal information maybe at risk to many types of internet attacks. Call us and learn how to secure your businesses data today. Malicious hackers attacked Microsoft's (Nasdaq: MSFT) India online retail store on Sunday evening, publishing obscured screenshots that appeared to contain personal user information. A Chinese hacker group known as "Evil Shadow Team" took responsibility for the breach, posting a message on Microsoft's website stating that the "unsafe system will be baptized." In what seemed to be a warning against Microsoft's unencrypted user information, the group posted screenshots of what appeared to be partially obscured user information, including login IDs and passwords. The group apparently found that information in plain-text, as opposed to encrypted files. The hackers refrained from publishing any screen shots that fully gave away user information, but Microsoft and Quasar Media, the Indian company that runs the retail site, advised users that they should change their log-on immediately.

Our team of certified computer repair technicians will implement an affordable computer security solution for your business. As of Tuesday morning in the U.S., the breached site was still down. Microsoft did not respond to our requests for comment. Microsoft joins a growing group of large companies that have been forced to deal with recent security breaches from relatively small, under-the-radar groups of hackers. "When the CIA and FBI networks are compromised at will, it should surprise no one that a company like Microsoft could have an isolated part of its sprawling network compromised," Larry Walsh, president of the 2112 Group, told TechNewsWorld.. Powerful networks and international government agencies are seeing a rise in cyberattacks in response to unpopular decisions, such as the U.S. government's recent crackdown on sites such as Megaupload and illegal file-sharing. Networks have been compromised by groups such as Anonymous, which state they're using hacktivism to spread a political or social message.

In addition to attacks in protest or the promotion of causes, though, retail and e-commerce sites have been taking more hits lately as well. The hacking group LulzSec got into Sony's (NYSE: SNE) systems last summer, obtaining users' personal information such as e-mail addresses, birthdates and passwords. The incident wreaked havoc with Sony's online services for weeks while it scrambled to plug the holes. "While some hacking methods are questionable and in fact illegal, they do reveal the insecurity of our digital world," said Walsh. Taking the necessary precautions to avoid that insecurity is an absolute necessity in today's climate, according to Mike Lloyd, CTO of RedSeal Networks. "To prevent this, likely targets need to use automation to understand weaknesses; today, it's all too easy for those who feel like it is to use their own automation tools to deface, degrade or even destroy online infrastructure," said Lloyd. Although Microsoft's U.S. security policies might have included encrypting data, a site run by a company on an entirely different continent might not adhere to the same policy. The growing threat of cyberattacks and increasingly vulnerable commerce sites need to serve as a warning to consumers about thinking twice before sending highly personal data online. "The important thing to remember in all of this is there's no such thing as 100 percent secure. Every site is vulnerable, just as your home is vulnerable to burglary. You can lock your windows and doors; you can even have an alarm system. But if someone wants into your house and they are determined, they will find a way in. It's the same with every website and online application," said Walsh.Keep hackers out of business wired networks and wireless networks in Newbury Park, Thousand Oaks, Westlake Village, and Agoura Hills, with ABComputer Repair's comprehensive computer security.

Missing Niobrara Woman Alive, Now In Police Custody A Niobrara woman missing since Sept. 25 has been found alive. Boyd County Sheriff Chuck Wrede confirmed Thursday night that 37-year old Amy Heiser has been arrested and is now in custody of law enforcement. More details on the arrest will be released Friday. A press release issued shortly after disappearance stated that the sheriff's office located her black 2000 GMC Yukon Denali at the public landing of Sunshine Bottom on the Missouri River on September 26 at approximately 12:30 p.m. Heiser was not found near the vehicle, but the sheriff's office says that items obtained in the vehicle lead authorities to believe she may have gone into the river. The Boyd County Sheriff's Office then contacted numerous other agencies to assist in the search for Heiser, including the Nebraska State Patrol, who lists Heiser as a missing person with an active search out to locate her. Thousands of man hours, hundreds of people and more than a dozen agencies joined the search to locate Heiser. Air patrol units and water units also assisted in the search of the area from the Sunshine Bottom public landing northeast of Lynch to an area near Verdel in northwestern Knox County. Authorities had been looking for Heiser for more than a month. She was set to appear in Holt County District Court on September 29 on a charge of possession of a controlled substance.
Ram Pam There is a flutter, the heart skips a beat and the sensation travels downwards towards the stomach, a tingle rushing across, as butterflies make a home and begin to dance. We know this feeling all too well - this is a new love. In Ram Pam, we find a girl in the throes of such a love, a love that our girl wants to shout from the rooftops to anyone who will listen - with earnestness, she declares the state of her heart to Baba Bhatti, a man who has decided to be a mentor and friend to her restless condition. At Coke Studio, it is Zoe Viccaji's voice that embodies the character of this girl. She tells Baba Bhatti of a newfound love that is making her heart go, "bam bam," and, "taara ra ram pam pam". The song's lyrics are lined with the slightest hint of melancholy. The object of her affections is not present, yet continues to occupy her thoughts obsessively. As she implores her love not to cause her sorrow or forget her, our girl declares that the loneliness caused by his absence has taken over her nights. Plagued by incessant dreams of her love, she tells Baba Jee that she belongs now completely to her dholna, that in her attempts to be with him, she could even court death for him. Her life now begins and ends with him: "tum pih shuru, tum pih khatum," she calls out to her absentee beloved. Stepping in to console his young mentee is Baba Bhatti, in the form of vocalist Shahab Hussain. For Shahab, this is his first time on the mainstage as a featured artist on Coke Studio. With his wisdom and foresight, Shahab's fictional, "najoomi" Baba recognizes the sincerity in Zoe's affections and promises to be her friend as she pursues her beloved. In this way, the girl finds a humsaya in Baba Bhatti and the two sing together in what becomes a fun, upbeat duet between two members of the Coke Studio family. Ram Pam is the creation of Sahir Ali Bagga, a songwriter known for his versatility with the theme of love, presenting it in soulful ballads, Punjabi bhangra duets and, now, quirky Urdu banter. "Sometimes in romance, you can be funny too, right?" says Bagga. "You can be happy, but you don't have to be dancing around like crazy, you can just be chilled out and funny with it," he explains the thought process behind Ram Pam. For Bagga, the lyrics came straight from a sentiment, from a mood of merriment and innocence that he decided to pen down, and the poetry made its way to Coke Studio's mainstage in Zoe and Shahab's voices. When asked to give the song's protagonist her voice, Zoe was drawn to it because of its happy, playful vibe and mix of genres. "It's a pop song ... and goes into a jazz section. Because I come from a jazz background, and that's the kind of music I really love ... I get to show my jazz chops. Then it goes into a very Eastern section, so it's really a mix of different genres [and] that's essentially what pop is." Mixing these genres was also challenging for the singer, a challenge that only added to the fun of the song, "Murkis (eastern singing technique) don't come naturally to me so it's been really fun to see how I can play with them and merge them with [contemporary] styles." Shahab happens to be an old friend of Zoe's so, for the two, this was a duet they fell into with ease. "Shahab and I go way back. We used to write songs together, like 7 years ago. I was really happy to find out that he was doing the part with me," says Zoe. The chemistry between the artists is important, Shahab explains, because of the unusual, quirky nature of the relationship between the characters of the song: "That relationships needs to show [in the performance]. We've tried our best to show our connection, through our words, our singing and also our actions." For Shahab, while performing with an old friend was a welcome leap onto the mainstage, the nerves still existed while preparing: "It was a transition, going from a chorus of four people to standing, just me, next to the artist. Everyone is treating me like an artist and trying to buck me up. Everything is happening around me, I'm not working around the artist, everyone is working around me." As he starts performing however, Shahab's nervousness falls away, and the thrill of the performance takes over: "My hands started moving along to the song, I seemed to grow four extra hands," he laughs, "From inside, I think I felt the same because when I stand at the backing vocalists' space, I'm giving it my 100%, I'm singing from my heart, I'm like that 5-year-old kid who is singing with all he's got, and I felt the same on the mainstage." The production experience behind this song is one of friendship and collaboration, in the end turning out to be as fun as the song's lyrics, a collective experience between colleagues and friends who have worked together, on and outside of Coke Studio. Shahab's fellow house band members tease and encourage him during the recording. Coke Studio resident Rachel Viccaji chimes in as Zoe rehearses, telling her sister to be less nervous, sharing inside jokes. "It's like coming back home," Zoe says of the experience, "It was a lot of fun, especially with the band because [they] were very upbeat. Everyone was laughing, interacting, there was good energy, so I had a really great time." Ultimately, Ram Pam is a light-hearted take on romance, a reminder that, maybe, love need not always be a serious or tragic business, and much like the protagonist of the song needs a friendly ear to hear her plight, at the end of the day, we all need our friends in times of angst, excitement and silliness. Ram Pam is a song that invites listeners to participate in the fun that was had during the experience of creating it. Read About Zoe Viccaji Read About Shahab Hussain Listen to Ram Pam
Tablets, iPads, and Slates - Oh My! Tablets, iPads, and Slates – Oh My! Interest is very strong right now with using the current array of tablet computers in the classroom – both with the use of Apple's iPad and, to a lesser degree, Android-based tablets. Many educators say they are finding success with these devices in the classroom, and we decided that it's time to find out for ourselves. About mid-February, using funds from a grant from the Seven Trees Foundation, two Apple iPads and two Samsung Galaxy Tab computers were placed in the hands of our third and fourth grade teachers, Mrs. Quigley, Mr. Leary, Mrs. Sherman and Mrs. Bender. The only instructions were to use them as they wished, and to pass along these instructions (and encouragements) to their students. We also provided a list of "functions" that we expected they could do or try with these devices, hoping that they would find these functions useful, and would then report back how well they performed. During this evaluation time, the Tech team visited with the teachers on several occasions to answer questions, and provide tips and help as needed. At the end of the "pilot" period, the teachers participated in a feedback session to share their thoughts with the technology department and the lower school division head. As expected, the tablet devices had all the attributes we had heard about – that also make them easy-to-use in a lower school classroom setting: light-weight, intuitive, long battery life – and they were fun and entertaining. They made good research tools, were good for reading e-books and were good for playing educational games. The Samsung had some minor advantages over the iPad, and the iPad had some minor advantages over the Samsung. Deficiencies were also noted – including the lack of anything that was acceptable as a substitute for MS Office, problems saving files and knowing where they were located at a later time, difficulty in collaboration, and problems printing. Overall, the iPads and Galaxy tablets are fun and useful machines, but they are not regarded as useful enough for third and fourth grades to replace the need for more traditional laptop, netbook, and desktop computers. Having said that – we'll keep our eyes and ears open, and look forward to running more tests and trials in the coming 20012-13 academic year to see how the technology – and our opinion on them – has changed.

Banjo music is often associated with Americana, bluegrass, folk, and country music, but the instrument has its roots in Africa as African American slaves in America created the banjo based on similar African instruments. Although we're most familiar with the fast, upbeat sound of banjo loops and dueling banjos found in Western banjo music, the banjo can also produce haunting, sad, melancholy sounds. The sharp, arpeggiated plucking of banjo stock production music can add a sense of flurries or action to your next video production. Banjo background music evokes that "down home" feeling, so add it any time you want to create a happy, nostalgic feeling. Search by specific mood, genres, and instruments to filter your search.
Lowell's Sponsors Trailapalooza August 6, 2010 April 8, 2016 Rob Morris 1 Comment Community In its early days, Lexington was built along the Middle Fork of South Elkhorn Creek, which was eventually known as Town Fork or, more commonly today, Town Branch. Lexington's early streets were oriented along the banks of this stream. If you don't remember a stream in downtown Lexington, you're not alone. Much of what was Town Branch is now buried under present-day Vine Street. Running underground along Vine Street and under the Lexington Center, Town Branch re-emerges in the Cox Street parking lot, and meanders along Manchester Street and Leestown Road. This area includes some of Lexington's most historic sites, such as McConnell Springs. Town Branch Trail, Inc. has been leading the efforts to build a greenway and urban trail along this historic corridor. Town Branch Trail recently completed its second phase of construction, with nearly two miles of completed trail for pedestrians and bicyclists. Lowell's is pleased to support these efforts. We think that initiatives like Town Branch Trail are an important part of making Lexington even more attractive and livable. So we are one of the sponsors of Trailapalooza, a festival along Town Branch Trail on Sunday, August 15th from 1 to 5 PM. The Big Maracas and the inimitable March Madness Marching Band will be entertaining. And PRESTO, the People-Powered Pianobike (which we are pleased to keep here at Lowell's), will be there as well. On top of that, we'll have games and prizes, too. Trailapalooza promises to be great fun for all ages. Lowell's encourages our friends and customers to come celebrate and support Town Branch Trail at Trailapalooza on August 15th. Visit Trailapalooza to get all of the details.

Lowell's won the voting even when matched up against other finalists (our good friends at Auto Tech and S&S Tire) who service all brands or who have multiple locations around the region.

LITTLE BIRD SERIES TO BE COLLECTED INTO HARDCOVER EDITION AVAILABLE THIS NOVEMBER The bestselling, critically acclaimed miniseries by Ian Bertram (House of Penance) and Darcy Van Poelgeest—Little Bird: The Fight for Elder's Hope—will be collected, in its entirety, into a hardcover edition and available from Image Comics this November. In the world of Little Bird: The Fight for Elder's Hope, North America has been devastated by three decades of war as the American Empire expands under an ultra-nationalist, theocratic government. But from the ashes of defeat rises Little Bird, a 12-year old girl who sets out to reignite the Canadian Resistance and discover her own identity in a world on fire. Bertram first burst onto the scene with his haunting, macabre collaboration with Peter J. Tomasi on House of Penance, the eerie, unsettling comic series about the Winchester haunted house. He brings a similarly intricate inking style to the pages of Little Bird. With the same limitless scope as a new East of West or Saga—and the drama and surrealism of Akira—Little Bird follows a young resistance fighter in a science-fiction style reminiscent of Alejandro Jodorowsky and Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale. Little Bird: The Fight for Elder's Hope hardcover edition (ISBN 978-1534313453, Diamond Code AUG190079) collects all five issues of the miniseries and will be available in comic shops on Wednesday, November 20 and in bookstores on Tuesday, November 26. It can be pre-ordered with your local comic shop or on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Books-a-Million, IndieBound, and Indigo. The digital edition of Little Bird: The Fight for Elder's Hope will also be available for purchase across many digital platforms, including the official Image Comics iOS app, Amazon Kindle, Apple Books, comiXology, and Google Play. Select praise for Little Bird: "It. Is. Amazing." —Patton Oswalt "Packed with rich ideas and executed with precision and passion. It's a comic that could be a cool movie in the future, but it succeeds because the creative team values the things that make comic books a unique form of storytelling." —The Onion's AV Club "We'll accept any excuse for more of Bertram's horror-tinged Otomo-esque aesthetic." —Paste Magazine "Little Bird is nothing short of a masterpiece...once you read this thing you'll see what we mean." —Nerdist "Powerful and thought-provoking...clever and well-rounded and the art is lovely in a surrealistic way. I highly recommend this series." —Impulse Gamer "Dark, surreal, and addictive." —Comic Book Resources ABOUT DARCY VAN POELGEEST Darcy Van Poelgeest is a multi-award winning writer and director living in Vancouver, B.C.

PSS Sleman vs Persipura Prediction 07.12.2021 PSS Sleman vs Persipura prediction and betting tips ahead of this Indonesia Liga 1 clash on Tuesday. Indonesia Liga 1 December 07 9:15 PSS Sleman WLDDWW Persipura LDWLLL PSIS Semarang vs PSS Sleman Persita vs PSS Sleman PSS Sleman vs Bhayangkara PSM vs PSS Sleman PSS Sleman vs PS TNI Borneo vs PSS Sleman Persipura vs Bhayangkara PSM vs Persipura Persipura vs PS TNI Borneo vs Persipura Persipura vs Bali United Persib vs Persipura PSS SLEMAN OR DRAW Double Chance @1.25 Bet Won FT: 1 - 1 PSS Sleman will welcome Persipura to for a matchday 16 fixture in Indonesia Liga 1. The last meeting on 19th September 2019 ended in a 1-1 draw. Both sides have met two times in the most recent seasons. PSS Sleman has won 0 matches, and Persipura failed to win on every occasion. Recent outings average 2.00 goals, while both teams score 100% of the time. PSS Sleman's latest fixture against PSIS Semarang ended in an away 2-1 win. PSS Sleman was very effective while counter-attacking. In the end, it was enough to make the difference between the two teams. PSS Sleman scored in both halves in the 16th and 66th minute. Persipura's recent game against Bhayangkara ended in a home 0-2 loss. Mutiara Hitam (Black Pearl) had plenty of possession, but not so much in the final third of the pitch. Since the start of the season, PSS Sleman is more dominant at home. They have four wins out of 10 games on home soil. Although PSS Sleman is among the most solid home teams in the league, they are far from perfect. Their defence is not as good as expected with just 10% home clean sheets. Persipura has picked up 9 points from the previous six league games. It is quite intriguing that they prefer playing on the road. Persipura has collected 1.00 points on average per away game, compared to 0.82 at home. To improve results, they have to be more compact in defence. Persipura kept a clean sheet in just 0% of their visits. It is hard to choose a favourite in this one. Both teams look evenly-matched and have their strengths. I am not willing to take a risk and prefer a double chance bet. My prediction is PSS Sleman or Draw. Both teams struggle in defence and concede on regular occasions. PSS Sleman failed to keep a clean sheet in 10% of home games, while Persipura conceded in 0% of away games. On average, both teams score in 64% of PSS Sleman's home and Persipura's away games. My prediction is Both Teams to Score: Yes.

Utah activists rally for immigration reform By: Caroline Connolly SALT LAKE CITY -- While Washington remains silent on a decision, the call for immigration reform is getting louder in Utah. Shouts of, "yes we can" came from the Latino community of Salt Lake City, who were rallying for change Friday night. "There's a lot of people who really deserve the chance to become a part of this country," said Edith Fernandez, one of dozens who attended. Fernandez moved to the United State from Mexico City with her husband in 1997. She now has two children, who were both born in Salt Lake, but she still lives here on work permits. "I have to go reapply, and I don't know: I just play it by ear, you know, by ear," Fernandez said. The path to citizenship continues to remain unclear for people, like Fernandez, as lawmakers continue to disagree on immigration legislation. "We've lived the worst of it in terms of a lot of the rhetoric that has happened over the last four of five years," said Tony Yapias of Proyecto Latino de Utah. On Wednesday, House democrats put pressure on republicans and unveiled their own bill for reform, which is nearly identical to the one the Senate passed in June. It includes a pathway to citizenship plan for the 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally, language that has not seen support from lawmakers in the past. "Our immigration system is broken. It needs to be fixed," Yapias said. But even if the proposal goes nowhere, those rallying Friday remained optimistic about their future in the U.S. "It`s time for a change, and it's time to give a lot of people a chance," Fernandez said.
Jimmy Kimmel or Jimmy Fallon: Which Late Night Talk Show Host Has the Higher Net Worth? Julia Mullaney The late-night talk show game has been seriously ramped up by the likes of Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon. Both of these hilarious guys have fan bases that overlap, but there are also people who tend to pick favorites. Although they have each found plenty of success, we can't help but wonder: Which of these hosts has the higher net worth? Jimmy Kimmel (left) and Jimmy Fallon | Kevin Mazur/Getty Images Both men have built similar careers Kimmel and Fallon essentially have the same job: They're both late-night talk show hosts who get paid to make us laugh by making light of current events and other hilarious endeavors. Kimmel hosts Jimmy Kimmel Live! While Fallon hosts The Tonight Show. Both have branched out to make appearances in movies or television shows beyond their own show, and the two appear to get along well. "My only complaint about Jimmy Fallon is the first name: Jimmy," Kimmel once said in an interview. "People get us mixed up all the time." Besides the beef about the same name, the two actually get along well. Jimmy Kimmel net worth: $45 million Kimmel's career started before he was even out of high school. He had a position on a radio show that aired on University of Nevada at Las Vegas' radio station. He hopped around several radio stations before getting involved with Comedy Central in the late 1990s. Working with the channel was what eventually drove him toward his own late-night talk show. In January 2003, Kimmel was given his own show, Jimmy Kimmel Live! (though it isn't actually aired live anymore). The show faced a few scandals now and then, including when it was briefly pulled from the air in 2004 after a comment Kimmel made during the NBA championship. However, Kimmel has mostly remained in society's good graces and is a widely respected comedian. His impressive career has built him an estimated net worth of around $45 million. Jimmy Fallon net worth: $45 million Fallon knew from a young age that he wanted to pursue comedy full time. He dropped out of college in 1995 to move to Los Angeles, where he instantly started booking shows. In 1998, Fallon landed a role on Saturday Night Live, and he was featured on the show up until 2004. He tried to break into the movie scene in the 2000s, and was the starring role in "Fever Pitch" alongside Drew Barrymore. However, he fared better in the comedy world, so he stuck to it. In 2009, Late Night With Jimmy Fallon made its debut, and Fallon was the host up until 2014, when he then took a job as the host of The Tonight Show (the show was formerly hosted by Jay Leno). Fallon, like Kimmel, has become a widely respected comedian and has a net worth that's estimated to be very similar to Kimmel's at $45 million. https://www.instagram.com/p/BIJHVS2Dvo8/?hl=en The two men have always been friendly. Despite the similar net worth, Fallon has a higher salary Although Kimmel and Fallon have similar careers and similar net worths, Fallon actually has the higher salary. According to CNBC, Fallon makes an estimated $16 million annually from his late show, while Kimmel makes an estimated $15 million. Kimmel tied with Stephen Colbert, while all three men edged out Conan O'Brien, who makes an estimated $12 million.
Home Editorials of Interest Taipei Times Tsai must defend nation's integrity Tsai must defend nation's integrity Tuesday, 09 January 2018 06:52 Taipei Times Editorial Editorials of Interest - Taipei Times Military might and diplomatic influence are two important political tools through which a nation demonstrates its power within the international system and shows its determination to safeguard its interests. It is sad to see Taiwan's weakness in those two fields as demonstrated by the President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) administration's reaction to recent developments in the Taiwan Strait. Beijing on Thursday last week unilaterally announced that it was opening the M503 and other connecting routes to northbound commercial flights. Given that M503 runs almost parallel to the median line of the Strait and is only 7.8km from it, Beijing no doubt has a military and strategic agenda that serves its political objectives. China's one-sided action not only contravenes the 2015 cross-strait agreement that opened the M503 route to southbound commercial traffic, but blatantly changes the "status quo" in the Strait. One day after the announcement, the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning, accompanied by other warships, sailed southwest along the Strait's median line and left Taiwan's air defense identification zone later that evening. While China's saber-rattling at Taiwan is nothing new, the latest move, in addition to the increased frequency of Chinese military aircraft circling Taiwan's international airspace, suggests that Beijing is taking advantage of what it perceives as a weak Tsai government. The Tsai government's responses to various acts of harassment from China tells not only Taiwanese but also Beijing that it is at its wits' end. Tsai has since Friday convened two national security meetings and Mainland Affairs Council Minister Katharine Chang (張小月) has lodged a protest against China over the route's opening. Tsai also tweeted that "Recent unilateral actions by #China — including M503 flight route & increased military exercises — are destabilizing & should be avoided. #Taiwan will continue to safeguard the status quo. We call on all parties to do the same." However, such reactions have no deterrent effect and most of the international community remain unaware of China's bullying of Taiwan. The government should hold international news conferences and make the severity of the situation known to the world. It should voice the nation's concerns and warn the international community of the threat China poses to peace and stability in the Strait. If the government remains quiet, how can it expect other nations to support Taiwan? At a news conference on Dec. 29, Tsai spoke of her determination "to foster an indigenous defense industry and defend Taiwan's democracy," adding that her administration would make reasonable annual increases in military spending. While Tsai's words were encouraging, budget figures tell a different story. The Executive Yuan has reduced the Ministry of National Defense's budget for fiscal 2018 from NT$3.9 billion to NT$3.27 billion (US$132.1 million to US$110.8 million), comprising 1.84 percent of GDP, down from the previous year's 1.86 percent and lower than the budget allocated during former president Ma Ying-jeou's (馬英九) administration. American Institute in Taiwan Chairman James Moriarty in October last year urged Tsai to heed US concerns about Taiwan's defense budget. While Taiwan should avoid an unnecessary arms race, an adequate and reasonable defense budget is called for, as it tells the public, as well as the world, that Taiwan is taking its defense seriously. Tsai can speak softly if she wants to, but as the head of state, she must demonstrate a tough attitude that asserts the nation's integrity — acting weak will only encourage China to continue its harassment of Taiwan. A handout photo provided by the Office of the President of Taiwan on 12 July 2016 shows an aerial photograph of Taiping Island, also known as Itu Aba Island in the South China Sea on March 23, 2016. Taiwan yesterday refused to accept a ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, Netherlands,which included a statement that Taiwan-controlled Itu Aba Island (Taiping Island, 太平島) in the Spratly Islands (Nansha Islands, 南沙群島) is a "rock," saying the verdict has severely infringed on Taiwan's rights over the South China Sea island and its surrounding waters.
Q: In usb C to audio jack systems, is the DAC in the dongle or in the host? I'd like to design my usb-c audio preamp, but that would be possible only if the analog audio comes directly from the phone, so that my piece of hardware can take the power supply from the usb-c and spit out an amplified version of that signal I looked around the internet and found a lot of contrasting information. Do the dongles receive a digital stream and convert it to analog audio, or are the dongles just a mechanical conversion between connectors and the dac is in the system (typically a phone)? What is the industry standard practice? What does the USB-IF say about audio via usb-c? How an host can recognize when an analog output is required? A: It depends. There are a few different ways to send audio over USB-C. The first way is the same way USB to Audio dongles work right now: The dongle is an actual USB device itself, one that supports one of the USB Audio profiles. This is a DAC that appears on a USB bus as an audio device, and will work just as readily on a desktop or any other device with USB-C and an OS that supports it. So, in this case, the DAC is very much in the dongle itself. It's more like a USB 'sound card', and will often be a little bulkier and more expensive. However, for most phones with a USB-C to 3.5mm dongle, the DAC is in the host device, meaning that the signals going out of the USB-C port and into the dongle are, in fact, analog ones. They're the exact same signals that get sent through any other 3.5mm headphone jack, and generated in the exact same way, by some kind of DAC inside the device with the USB C port. So in most cases, yes, the dongle is merely an electrical/mechanical connection that is adapting a USB-C port to a 3.5mm audio jack directly. It would not make much sense to use a dongle that had an entire DAC and USB audio profile chipset inside it, as this would incur a good deal of cost, consume more power, and be physically bulkier. If the device is a phone, then it already must have a DAC of some kind or it would be unable to drive the speaker that lets you hear the person on the other end of a phone call. These usually come in the form of single chip solutions and will include multiple input and output channels, so this can be done effectively for free. I do not know why, but there seems to be a ton of misinformation regarding this online which it sounds like you've likewise encountered. What I see most often is something along the lines of 'USB-C is digital audio only' or 'USB-C doesn't have any audio pins'. ...and neither statement is true, at least according to the USB-IF, the only body who has any authority on the matter. Or just download the official PDF (warning, 20MB .zip) and scroll down to page 213, there is a whole section on it.
Duncan Cameron: 'Happy campaigner' Trudeau makes it Black Monday for the NDP Duncan Cameron | On the campaign trail, the personality contrast between Trudeau and the two other main leaders was enough to push the new prime minister ahead. A Liberal victory may improve fortunes of First Nation communities across Canada Krystalline Kraus | The voter turnout for this election has been the highest we've seen since 1993, with more than 17 million Canadians casting a ballot, hoping to improve their fortunes with a change of power in Ottawa.

On 17 May 1791, King Christian the Seventh gave his permission to smallholder Peter Andresen to run a brickworks at Nybøl Nor. Already the owner of a small farm at the place, Peter Andresen was therefore the first brick maker in the Petersen family. Today, the brickworks is run by Christian A. Petersen and his daughters, respectively the seventh and eighth generation in a direct line. The 6.5 km² large Nybøl Nor was then, as now, ideal for brickwork industry. The coastline of the cove had rich glacial clay deposits and the cove had a direct navigable connection to Flensborg Fjord. Back in the 1700s, several brickworks were lying side by side. With about 50 brickworks, the concentration was then the largest in Northern Europe. Today, six brickworks remain. From being a local brickworks founded more than 220 years ago, Petersen Tegl has developed into a highly specialised company with global exports. Developments have been achieved - and still are - in cooperation with architects from all over the world.
NS-Capture Theory The Key Concepts The Theories The Proofs Predictions of NS-Capture How to Use the Website Analogy: "You can't go down the up escalator!" Rich Levinson In science, it is generally useful to come up with easy-to-understand analogies, or metaphors that relate to the subject being discussed. In this context what we are trying to do is come up with an analogy that helps us understand the problems with: the existing theory of pulsars (which we refer to as the NS-Creation Theory (neutron star creation theory)) and why these problems force us to consider: a new theory of pulsars (which we refer to as the NS-Capture Theory (neutron star capture theory)) The analogy can be summarized as follows: Isolated pulsars found in the midst of supernova remnants are found to be spinning rather fast but also slowing down: so we can consider this state of affairs as the neutron star pulsar being on the "down escalator", i.e. slowing down (spinning down). Pulsars found in binary systems are found to be spinning rather slow but also spinning faster: so we can consider this state of affairs as the neutron star pulsar being on the "up escalator". i.e. speeding up (spinning up). So we can consider: slow, spinning-up binary pulsars as being on an "up escalator" (where the presence of the binary companion can be considered to be an "up escalator" as far as the neutron star is concerned) fast, spinning-down isolated pulsars as being on a "down escalator" (where the absence of any companion (i.e. being isolated) can be considered to be a "down escalator" The problem uncovered by this state of affairs has to do with how a pulsar is "created". NS-Creation theory claims that a pulsar is created as a result of a supernova explosion, i.e. an isolated star explodes and the corresponding implosion creates a neutron star in a fast spinning state, albeit, slowing down from the moment of its birth. Since there really can't plausibly be two completely different ways to create a neutron star, NS-Creation theory must apply also to the creation of the neutron stars found in binary systems, i.e. the slow spinning up neutron star pulsars found in binary systems. Therefore, the only plausible way to create a neutron star in a binary system using NS-Creation theory is to assert that the binary system originally consisted of two more or less normal stars (there are billions of normal binary star systems in the Milky Way galaxy), and that one of those normal stars experienced a supernova explosion which transformed the previously normal star into a neutron star pulsar, thus transforming binary system from being a system containing two normal stars into a system containing one normal star plus on neutron star pulsar. This is where the basic problem with NS-Creation theory becomes somewhat obvious: NS-Creation theory produces a fast spinning neutron star pulsar as one member of a binary system with a normal star companion. Unfortunately for NS-Creation theory, this fast-spinning pulsar finds itself on an "up-escalator", which will cause it to spin faster and faster. Therefore NS-Creation theory has failed because by being a fast pulsar that is spinning up, there is no way for the pulsar to get into the state that pulsars in binary systems are generally found: i.e. slow-spinning i.e. there is no way for a fast spinning pulsar in a binary system to slow down to become a slow-spinning pulsar, because it is born on an "up escalator" and cannot possibly slow down. The above logic shows that NS-Creation theory leads to a self-contradiction, and that logic compels us to find a new explanation for the creation of pulsars that begin their life in a slow-spinning state. The result of this logic is the assertion of the NS-Capture Theory that is what all the discussion on this web site is about. One thought on "Analogy: "You can't go down the up escalator!""

Tired of Boring Jack-O-Lanterns? Spice UP Your Home With a Crayon Melt Pumpkin This Fall! Although it is hard to believe, Halloween is just over 2 weeks away! Decorating for autumn and Halloween can be so much fun. However, the same old DIY fall decor can get a little boring. This year, why not spice things up a bit with with a rainbow crayon pumpkin! My very favorite Youtuber, Joey Graceffa, and his pal Tiffany dedicated a video specifically on the 411 on how to create a rainbow pumpkin by melting crayons with a hair dryer! The process to making a decorated crayon pumpkin is simple but a little messy (probably messier than traditional pumpkin painting)! Read on to find more. Newspaper or some sort of floor cover/wall cover (this is optional, but if you are doing this project inside you will definitely want to cover your floor and the walls around you). Begin by peeling the wrappers of the crayons you plan to use. You can use whatever colored crayons you want, just keep in mind the colors will bleed together and may create undesirable colors. Glue the crayons around the top of the pumpkin. You can either break the crayons in half or into smaller pieces as you glue them. Once the glued on crayons have dried on, turn on your hairdryer and start melting those crayons! Move the hairdryer around the pumpkin and watch the crayons melt! Allow the wax to dry, and your pumpkin will be all ready to go! Happy rainbow crayon pumpkin decorating! If you live along the upper east coast of the United States, you are probably preparing for the impending snow storm that is expected to hit sometime between Friday night and Saturday morning. Hopefully at this point you have all the food and supplies you might need during the storm. Snowstorms like this one are good excuses to spend your weekend relaxing at home. You can get cozy in your warmest pajamas and heat up a nice cup of coffee or tea and enjoy the snow day (or days!) Although snow storms can be relaxing or romantic, they can also make some people feel bored and even a little stir-crazy. To deal with those feelings of boredom, why not do some fun, cheap crafts that will preoccupy you and your family while the flakes fly! We even have some fun and easy ideas for DIY crafts for kids. Have your children create edible snowmen out of marshmallows. This project works best with jumbo sized marshmallows. You can use chocolate chips, mini M&Ms, or food coloring to make eyes and pretzel sticks or spaghetti noodles for arms. Microwave your snowman for a few seconds to make an ooey gooey treat. Make a beautiful decoration for your front door from pine cones, paint, glitter, ribbon, hot glue, and plastic snowflakes. Paint white paint down over your pine cones. Before the paint dries, sprinkle white or silver glitter over the pine cones. At one end of each pine cone, tie or hot glue ribbon (it looks best with white ribbon) to the base of the pine cone. Attach a piece of ribbon to your small plastic snow flakes. Once your pine cones have dried, tie the ribbons from each pine cone and plastic snow flake together in a knot. Hang this lovely winter decoration from your door! Put food coloring in spray bottles with water and have your children create beautiful works of art out in the snow. Create detailed paper snowflakes by folding white paper into a square. Make numerous cuts into your paper with scissors to create a beautiful snowflake that can be hung from your ceiling or windows! Your children might enjoy these FREE printable coloring pages for kids. These pages are winter weather themed, but there are other types of coloring pages as well. Create your own easy winter wreath with a foam hoop, tulle (in white, blue, and/or silver), small plastic snow flakes, and small color coordinating colored balls (Christmas balls work well). Cut strips of tulle that are all the same length. Then, tie them tightly around the foam hoop. Alternate colors as you tie the tulle around the hoop. Continue tying the tulle until you have it completely encircling the hoop. Then, hot glue the snowflakes and Christmas balls around the perimeter of the hoop. Voila, you have a beautiful winter wreath! Indoor picnic ideas are also great for snowy days. You can let your children help you plan and prepare the food. Get a nice picnic blanket out and feast on your tasty indoor picnic meal while you watch the snow fall. Have a safe and enjoyable snow day (or multiple snowy days if you live in the mid Atlantic region too)!
The history of universities almost always begins with a collection of wise individuals who fund the foundation of an institution to ensure that learning can occur freely and benefit the community. The HTET Founders' Fund Fund invited 100 individuals, businesses and organisations with the foresight to understand the value that a new university will bring to Herefordshire, to make a minimum donation of £5,000 to realise the vision of a university in Hereford. The Fund enabled the Herefordshire Tertiary Education Trust to retain the breadth of professional expertise required to launch a unique university that will support the revitalisation of Herefordshire, drive educational aspiration in the county, and help our businesses and young people be ready for the challenges of the 21st Century. The Founders' Fund is now closed. Thank you to our current Founders who have made the development of NMiTE possible. British Cassis – Whittern Farms Ltd. Impact Print & Design Ltd.

The great purge: Hindutvas Cultural Revolution Ganesh Devy Two apparently unrelated yet deeply interconnected events of July invite serious reflection. One belongs to an unending story of crime, the other a not-so-interesting bureaucratic muddle. One will continue to fetch headlines for long and the other will survive, if it does at all, in footnotes for researchers. Yet, both are of a piece in a larger plot threatening our republic. One is a murder story, the other is a sordid saga of a genocide of a kind. Throughout the month of July, reports of arrests of the suspects in the Gauri Lankesh murder featured in the news. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the Karnataka government deserves praise for getting closer to cracking the conspiracy behind the murder of several intellectuals. Those involved in the Gauri Lankesh murder are believed to have had a hand in killing Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare and MM Kalburgi. Press reports tell us that many others are on the hit list. Some reports say that the list has some 50 names. The SIT will be able to ascertain or deny this. As a result of the recovery of the list of to be murdered writers and thinkers, some 15 writers in Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra had to be provided special security. In recent weeks, I have met several writers and thinkers who have had to move around with these security men accompanying them. The whole sequence of murders and their fallout sends a clear signal to writers, journalists and thinkers: do not speak or write anything that will critique the Hindutva forces and the government that tacitly supports them. It is another thing that many writers and journalists still show the courage to speak up when it is necessary to do so. Yet, the atmosphere of intimidation and fear is pervasive. Earlier this week, the Goa assembly witnessed a on the threats made to writers. While Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar assured the legislature that security was being provided to the writers, he avoided answering why the organisation issuing the threat, which is located in Goa and is clearly named by the investigating agencies in Maharashtra and Karnataka is not being banned or restricted. And, therein lies the rub. Several times, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stated that violence and mob-lynching will not be tolerated. That is admirable. The only difficulty is, every time an assault takes place, it is the victim that is placed in the dock. The perpetrators continue to roam all over, unhindered, free. I now turn to the relatively less eye-catching event of July 2018. The Census of India 2011 data related to languages was released by the Census office. With all its tables and charts, it looks perfectly harmless. But, scratch the surface and you find that it is heavily doctored. It tells us that in 2011, our countrymen stated a total of 19,569 raw returns (read, non-doctored claims). Out of these, close to 17,000 were outright rejected and another 1,474 were dumped because not enough scholarly corroboration for them exists. Only 1,369, or roughly 6% of the total claims, were admitted as classified mother tongues. Rather than placing them as languages, they were grouped under 121 headings. These 121 were declared as languages of India. One may ask, but how does this matter? It matters because the data for Hindi has been bolstered shown at 52 crore-plus people by adding to its core figure of speakers, the speakers of nearly 50 other languages These include Bhojpuri, claimed by over five crore people, and many languages in Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Bihar, claimed by close to a total of six crore people. At the same time, 17 of the 22 scheduled languages are reported by the Census as showing a downward trend in their rate of growth in comparison to the growth in the previous decade. The architecture of the presentation of the language census data has at its foundation the principle of exclusion.The exclusion is imposed on the languages that the people of India have claimed in the census exercise as being their languages. To use a term from the medical sciences, this act amounts to imposing an involuntary aphasia on citizens. In this instance, the numbers on whom it is imposed run into crores of people. And that is no small matter. Since our Constitution gives us the fundamental and non-negotiable right to free expression, and since it not only accepts but encourages the idea of a multilingual India, is there not something profoundly unconstitutional in writers and thinkers or in wilfully suppressing peoples languages? The UNESCO brief for language rights describes denial of mother tongues or any wilful concealment of a mother tongue by the member-states as equivalent to genocide A strong word, indeed, but necessary, the UNESCO thinks. Quite ironically, the justification for both actions is drawn from a common source; and that is, a deeply flawed idea of nationalism. It holds that anyone critical of the current regime is an enemy of India, an anti-national trying to spread disaffection towards the State, or in simpler words, seditious. With respect to languages, the argument says that if we have a large multiplicity of languages, it may result in disintegration of our national territory. Love for the nation and its integrity are, of course, of prime importance. But a nation becomes great by the thought and knowledge it produces, by nurturing freedom of the mind and by the fearlessness of its citizens. States that consciously encourage creating societies that are incapable or cannot critique the system generate what in ancient Latin is described as hegemony. And, governments that become intolerant of differences of opinion become heavy with hubris. Hubris and hegemony produce a pervasive mediocrity. Excessively proud rulers, intellectual mediocrity and lynch-mobs form a combine that threatens speech and forces civilisations to close their minds. https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/main-article/great-purge-686689.html Courtesy: Deccan Herald Previous Post:Scientists have established a link between brain damage and religious fundamentalism Next Post:Indian rationalism, Charvaka to Narendra Dabholkar Rise from your knees; cease your mindless murmurs to a god who does not exist or, at best, does not care; and accept the world as it actually is.

this jawn "Keep your Marxist hands off Gritty": WSJ writer fumes over allegations that a furry mascot is antifa By Rex Santus Oct 8, 2018 Gritty, the bright orange, furry, 7-foot creature of Philadelphian origin, is no longer a simple mascot for a hockey team: Antifa activists have co-opted him as their own. In fact, they so effectively claimed Gritty as a working-class, leftist icon that the Wall Street Journal was forced to publish an anguished op-ed Monday demanding that these people keep their "Marxist hands off Gritty." "The same leftists who want statues of Thomas Jefferson removed are now petitioning for Gritty to replace Mayor Frank Rizzo on a downtown mural," Jillian Kay Melchior said in the Wall Street Journal op-ed. "Gritty belongs to Philadelphia, not to far-left activists. Still, in an era when everything from Nike and the NFL to your local restaurant is a political battlefield, this development is as predictable as it is sad," she said. "Not only can't we have nice things; we can't even have silly, creepy things." Leftist activists immediately latched on to Gritty after the Philadelphia Flyers introduced him as their new mascot in late September. The socialist magazine Jacobin, for example, tweeted on Sept. 26 that "Gritty is a worker." An anti-capitalist Gritty parody account sprouted up on Twitter on Oct. 2, and it has already amassed thousands of followers. The Daily Beast reported last week that Gritty is an "anti-fascist now, and there's nothing you can do about it." But it's more than just a joke on the internet. When Donald Trump visited Philadelphia last week, protesters showed up carrying signs that showed Gritty waving an antifa flag and wearing anarchist imagery. "Gritty is a symbol of Philadelphia," Philadelphia-based group The Liberation Project told the Daily Beast. "It's not that he's an anti-fascist character; it's that he's representative of the people, and the people of Philadelphia are grittily anti-fascist." And in a twist that may become even more troubling to op-ed writers at the Wall Street Journal, the Twitter love for Gritty has taken on a distinctly romantic edge, with some even calling for sexy Gritty Halloween costumes. Is NOTHING sacred?

Sarah Grey is an actress known for her role in TV shows like Bates Motel, where she plays the role of young Norma Bates. Her appearance in other shows like Legends of Tomorrow, Almost Human and the 2018 Netflix show, The Order has won her a lot of adoration from her fans. Her portrayal of Alyssa, the female lead, in The Order is exemplary! Sarah Grey Bio: Age, Parents Sarah Grey was born in Nanaimo, Canada on 19 May 1996. Of Canadian nationality, she has not revealed her ethnicity yet. When she was young, Sarah was less girly and more like a tomboy- she was a climber and used to climb walls and trees! The actress is very close to her mother and her sister Allison Grey, who is a photographer, hairstylist, and makeup artist. She regularly posts pictures with her family, which shows that she shares a special bond with them. You Don't Want To Miss: Alison Rich Wiki, Age, Husband, Height Sarah Grey spends quality time with her family on 28 August 2016 (Photo: Sarah Grey's Instagram) Sarah Grey's popularity is only increasing and today she has become an important person in the industry. However, she still has not forgotten her parents and their contributions in her life. She regularly visits them and even goes on trips and celebrates important occasions together. Sarah is not only close to her biological parents but is also very close to her on-screen parents. Her on-screen father Jack Wagner is constantly featured in her Instagram and Twitter posts, which shows that she likes to have a good bond with all of her coworkers. At the young age of 22, Sarah stands at a tall height of 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 meters) and maintains her weight of 54 kgs (119 lbs). Her body is of ideal shape, and her good looks and demeanor just compliment her body. No wonder many men are already going crazy about her! An interesting fact about the actress- she believes music is the best therapy and is interested in singing. Is The Actress Dating A Boyfriend? Sarah is a very private person and does not like to reveal much information about her love life. Sarah is very active on social media, but her Twitter and Instagram posts rarely involve any men that can be suspected of being her boyfriend. Peek Inside: Jodhi May Married, Lesbian, Parents Even in the past, Sarah Grey's name has not been associated with any men. Either she is very good at hiding her secret boyfriend, or she has not been involved in any of the serious relationships until now. But, she is only 22 right now, so the latter one seems more plausible. It seems like Sarah is currently focusing on her career and is not dating anyone. If she finds any man with whom she wants to share a relationship with, she will undoubtedly introduce him to her fans.

Together, we can work it out with Mediation. I want to help you get through your divorce or the breakup of your relationship. I am a family law attorney who has worked with divorcing families for almost 35 years. There is nothing pleasant about getting a divorce or breaking up with your significant other. It can be very difficult. Are you feeling anger, hurt, pain, guilt, shame, or sadness? You are not alone. So, how can you, who are going through one of the worst experiences of your life, be expected to make decisions that will affect you for the rest of your life? You are at your worst when you need to be at your best. I can help. I will explain the legal issues that you and your significant other need to talk about… And, I can help you talk about them in a safe, respectful environment. This doesn't mean that mediation won't be free from emotions, but wouldn't you rather meet with your significant other in a private conference room than in a courtroom? Couples that work out their own agreements emerge with fewer scars than those who fight tooth and nail. They save time, they save money, and most importantly, they are able to remain civil to each other. What if you and your significant other are getting along, in spite of the decision to separate? I can help you by giving you legal information to make certain all of your legal issues are being addressed.
Is it a must-win for Slippery Rock? I think it is. Even if Hillsdale loses next week to Indy;they are in with their win today. Yea, A one loss Kutztown gets in over a two loss SRU. An SRU win makes it interesting. WCU and SRU in and Ktuz out? Crazy to think a 1-loss PSAC team could be left out. The playoffs have started for Slimey. There is no luxury for a loss now. A lot depends on the Gmac games, and who loses the Post New haven game. Its very possible that both Hillsdale and Tiffin lose next week. If Rock wins, Hillsdale loses and new haven loses, I think the Psac gets 3 teams in. THough Edinboro is not a gimme for KU. Tiffin loses again they may be out, too. If Edinboro can't figure out it's passing attack they'll nudge Kutztown toward the playoffs. The teams are too similar statistically speaking for Edinboro's offense to be as one dimensional as it was against IUP. I would say 4 teams have already locked their playoff participatation. Notre Dame, West Chester, New Haven, Post. Hillsdale is probably the only team that may get with 2 losses. I think the only way the Psac gets 3 teams is if Findlay beats Tiffin. Opens the door for a 9-2 Ohio Dominican. Maybe. They took an SOS anchor yesterday. Another one next week. You may have Shepherd, ODU, IUP and Fairmont all with 2 losses. The math can sort it from there. Unless the both get in the rankings this week; they have no chance. The loser of Post/New Haven will fail only to 6th or 7th depending on other results. The NE-10 is getting 2 teams in. Its possible that no 2 loss teams get in. Rock, WCU, KU, New haven, Post NDC Tiffin, and even Hillsdale could have 1 or 0 losses. and 6 of those teams are average squads! That's what sitting in the back of my mind. SR1 has - if I counted correctly - eight teams with no more than one loss. That never seems to matter come selection time. I know this. This is why this region won't have a chance in the final 4.
Friday is traditionally a far busier day than Thursday at the Festival of Speed presented by Mastercard, and so it proved this year with crowds flocking to the paddocks and race routes. The 70th Anniversary celebrations for Porsche continued with a display at the front of the house of cars, music and fireworks. It wasn't the only display centring on the house on Friday. Renowned trials bike rider Dougie Lampkin put on a show on the roof of the house. Back on terra firma, the Borg-Warner Trophy – an impressive 1.6-metre tall trophy awarded to the winner of the Indianapolis 500 – made an appearance on the front steps. It's the first time the trophy has been to Europe, and only the second time it has left the USA, in 82 years. There was lots of action on the hillclimb too, with F1 cars from past and present taking part for the first time this year. Some of the contenders for Sunday's timed runs were putting down early markers too. Andy Reid driving the BAC Mono headed the time sheets, followed by Peter Dumbreck in the electric NIO EP9. Slightly slower were two autonomous efforts. A classic Mustang converted by Siemens took a gentle drive up the hill, along with the completely unmanned Roborace car. The Bonhams auction saw action of a different kind. An Aston Martin DB4GT Zagato that has been in one owner's collection for 47 years sold for £10m, while a BMW 507 owned from new by John Surtees sold at £3.8m. It's been an eventful day, as you can see from the gallery below.

The modern literature on the relationship between financial development and economic growth and development is rooted in research conducted during the 1950s and 1960s.

Q: Progressive Company: Do you need Active Directory for a 100 person company? We are a progressive company (about 100 employees) and would like to hear other's input. In today's XaaS/cloud world where most of the services and applications are in the cloud (file sharing, calendar, crm, cms, erp, email/gmail, etc...) do you still need Active Directory? The entire notion of getting Windows Servers to manage single sign on, software updates, restrict user access to their machines, seems all very IT 1.0. If you assume that 80+% of your applications/services are in the cloud, and you run a mixed environment (win, mac, linux) what value does Active Directory, and the rest of the Windows stack really bring? Other than employ more Windows IT VARs/Consultants? Aren't these desktops basically just thin clients that have a web browser? Sure you will have some applications such as MS Office, or perhaps some Graphical tools like Photoshop or alike, but other than that most everything that is "mission critical" is in the cloud. These desktops are essentially disposable. Why would one need Active Directory? A: You don't need it — you never did, there were always other ways — but you will find that Active Directory is exceptionally helpful at keeping 100 workstations operational, efficient, and working together. You will also find there are some things you do need, such as dns and dhcp services, that Active Directory makes very easy. Once you're up past about 50 machines, your name resolution and dhcp services aren't going to live on a consumer level cable modem any more. You're gonna need a old-school server of some kind to handle this. Active Directory can do that for you. Of course, so could OS X server, CentOS, or a few other free linux alternatives. What Active Directory is really good at for a Windows shop that the alternatives don't do yet is that, as an administrator, when you join your computers to the domain a random person off the street can't just walk up and log in to one of your employees machines. There's a certain amount of real security there. This isn't a whole lot out of the box, as there are tools that can trivially reset passwords, but if you're willing to go with whole-disk encryption, which AD can enforce, you can get there. At the same time, as an administrator you can walk up to any machine you're responsible and log in with an account that will grant you administrator privileges on the machine. Your users will be able to log in to any computer you control (including the brand new one you just gave them because they broke their old one) and easily find their old files. If you want to restrict the users to only their assigned computer, that's easy to do also. As the company grows, this kind of segmentation will become more important. Most data breaches are inside jobs, and one of the functions of IT that is important is to help prevent this kind of leak.
Q: Filtering nested arrays and selecting specific properties using az cli JMESPath I am trying to query a response from the following az command: az provider operation show --namespace Microsoft.KeyVault I want to query all operations that relate to secrets to be able to build a custom role for a RBAC enabled key vault. This is a short excerpt from the entire response: { "displayName": "Microsoft Key Vault", "id": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/providerOperations/Microsoft.KeyVault", "name": "Microsoft.KeyVault", "operations": [ { "description": "Registers a subscription", "displayName": "Register Subscription", "isDataAction": false, "name": "Microsoft.KeyVault/register/action", "origin": null, "properties": null }, { "description": "Unregisters a subscription", "displayName": "Unregister Subscription", "isDataAction": false, "name": "Microsoft.KeyVault/unregister/action", "origin": null, "properties": null } ], "resourceTypes": [ { "displayName": "Secret", "name": "vaults/secrets", "operations": [ { "description": "View the properties of a secret, but not its value.", "displayName": "Read Secret Properties", "isDataAction": false, "name": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/read", "origin": null, "properties": null }, { "description": "Creates a new secret or updates the value of an existing secret.", "displayName": "Write Secret", "isDataAction": false, "name": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/write", "origin": null, "properties": null } ] } ], "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/providerOperations" } I would like to extract the description as well as the name from the object in the array resourceTypes where resourceTypes.name=="vaults/secrets". I am trying to build this gradually, but I am stuck on even filtering out this object. This is where I'm at, and I've derived this from the JMESPath documentation on filtering arrays: az provider operation show --namespace Microsoft.KeyVault --query "[?resourceTypes.name=='vaults/secrets']" This is just empty however. The end result I am after is a tabular output with the description and name from each operation within the operations array. Any help would be greatly appreciated. A: The issue in your current query is that doing [] would assume you address an array at the root of your JSON, when what you have at the root of your JSON is a map: { "resourceTypes": [ { "name": "vaults/secrets", } ] } So, the beginning of the query to address your JSON should rather be resourceTypes[?name == 'vaults/secrets'] While your query would work on a JSON looking like: [ { "resourceTypes": { "name": "vaults/secrets", } } ] From there on, you need to query the operations array, so operations[] and do a multiselect hash to trim down the map to the fields you are looking for. We end with the query: resourceTypes[?name == 'vaults/secrets'] .operations[] .{ description: description, name: name } And, lastly, to format it in table, you can use the table output format of the Azure client. We end up with the line: az provider operation show \ --namespace Microsoft.KeyVault \ --query "resourceTypes[?name == 'vaults/secrets'] .operations[] .{ description: description, name: name }" \ --out table

The Wildcat Voice Drama Club takes a bow at sixth annual recital Ilana Miller, Staff Writer On Wednesday, March 21, twenty-four students performed in a theater recital in the Mayfield Middle School auditorium as a part of the Drama Club's culminating event. The recital consisted of nine scenes which were narrated by eighth grade student, Hailey Nelson. Each scene was a fractured fairy tale, so they included characters and events from fairy tales and nursery rhymes but added twists to the plots. For example, one scene, called "Lost and Found," was about Little Bo Peep meeting Mary (from "Mary Had a Little Lamb") while looking for her lost sheep. Another scene, "You Lookin' at Me?" depicted Little Red Riding Hood teaching a self defense class, which was attended by Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, and Cinderella. Students had costumes and props for their scenes that ranged from pig ears, noses, and tails to pumpkins to a crown and cape. Mariana Quinones, an eighth grader who acted in the recital, stated that she really likes performing, explaining, "Getting to turn into this whole new person is really fun." "A Party to Die For" Mary Jo Baetzold, seventh-grade Drama Club member, described performing as "a little scary as you're coming on the stage" but added "because we've practiced so much…you forget about the people who are watching you because you are so engaged with the play." As fun as performing can be for many Drama Club members, it takes a lot of work to put on a recital. Students participating were each assigned one or two scenes for which they had to rehearse, memorize lines, and learn blocking. Scenes were assigned based on the actors' personalities and what role the club advisers believed would be best for them. He Called for His Fiddlers…Two? Students met directly with their partners and one of the club advisers to work on their scene. They also attended meetings in which they ran through the recital; this included one dress rehearsal the day of the performance. Many students spent time outside of school preparing for their scenes, too. Seventh grader Angie Marvaldi looked over her scripts a lot and ran lines with her family members. Sarah Fricke, also in seventh grade, also practiced her lines with her family as well as over the phone with her scene partners. Mrs. Saunders stated that seeing the hard work that the students put in to being performance-ready was one of her favorite things about the recital, adding, "I like the energy of it… [and] the sense of accomplishment that students feel when it's finally done." Mrs. Bean agreed, saying she likes seeing students feel successful after performing. She also enjoys seeing kids coming out of their shells and having the chance to feel like they belong. A copy of the program Mrs. Bean and Mrs. Saunders held the first recital when they started Drama Club six years ago. They wanted to give students some drama experience for fun and possibly aid their pursuits of participating in high school or community theater. They chose to have a recital, as opposed to a play, so everyone would be able to participate equally. Mrs. Saunders remarked, "I was really happy with [the recital]. The students did a great job…and the audience enjoyed it."

'Full House' house for sale for $4.15 million; you will never achieve your childhood dreams Caroline Linton Are you a widower with three children and some (possibly) freeloader friends who want to live with you allegedly to take care of your children? Then we've got the perfect house for you! It's slightly used: Not only was it originally constructed in 1883, but it once (and now again) houses the Tanner family from Full House and it's for sale for $4.15 million. Wait, what? $4.15 million?!! Didn't Danny Tanner turn 30 years old in the first season of Full House? It's time for a brutal life lesson: Your childhood television shows lied to you and you will never achieve your dreams of living in that world. You will never afford the apartment on Friends either, and oh hey remember Cliff Huxtable? No, don't do it. Although under further review, it appears that on a show where Danny Tanner is a widower with three children with a successful journalism career before he turned 30 that the biggest fiction is the house itself. While there is a finished basement with a bathroom where Joey lived and then later become a recording studio, the real estate listing mentions no attic for Uncle Jesse and Rebecca and the twins. There are three bedrooms, not four, so all three girls would have to share a bedroom or something. And there's apparently a "formal dining room," which we never once saw because why eat in a nice dining room when you can sit on a bench in the kitchen? The house is being re-filled with DJ's family in the Netflix sequel, Fuller House. The listing does not mention if they will come with the house, since this family does not like to move or become less co-dependent. Given the differences between the house's interior and the set that actually doesn't make sense (how can there be four huge bedrooms above those two regular-sized rooms on the first floor?), it's perhaps unsurprising that the show was filmed on a lot in Burbank. As you start crying about your lot in life since you not only can't afford the house at 1709 Broderick St. but you also could never support friends and family members who don't appear to pay rent in it, San Francisco in the past 30 years has undergone a dramatic change due to gentrification and the booming tech industry. A 2014 Brookings study named the city has having the fastest-growing income inequality in the nation, and San Francisco was recently named the least affordable city in the world Besides, some dark things happen when you live in a Full House universe.
Developed thousands of years ago in India, Ayurvedic - also known as Ayurveda is one of the world's oldest holistic (whole-body) healing systems. Ayurveda is based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body and soul. The Orchard Ayurveda Programmes focus in promote good health, rather than fight disease. But treatments may be recommended for specific health problems. In Ayurveda theory, everything in the universe -- living or not -- is connected. Good health is achieved when your mind, body, and spirit are in harmony with the universe. Disruptions (injuries, age, emotions, genetic or birth defects, climate and seasonal changes) of this harmony can lead to poor health and sickness. Experience holistic healings and become whole again in body, mind and soul. Ayurveda is beneficial in restoring balance, improving spiritual healing, boost immunity and reduce disease symptoms. Our Ayurveda Programs include aromatherapy, breathing exercises, diet and lifestyle changes, herbs, plant-based oils and spices, meditation, stretching and yoga.
The emojis have always been appreciated by all users. They manage to give that touch of expression to cold phrases that are exchanged via smartphone. Among the various features of Windows 10, there is a rich panel of emojis to use with your computer. This feature is very useful especially when you usually write and send messages with your PC. There are two different ways to insert emojis from a PC with Windows 10. The first method we recommend is the simplest and fastest method. To open the emoji panel, just press the Windows key and the key at the same time .(dot) on any screen. This shortcut activates the panel with all the emojis available in Windows 10. You can move the window to your liking and close it when you think it's appropriate. By default, the emoji panel does not close automatically after inserting a face. This allows you to enter as many emoji you want without having to re-open the panel in question each time. The developers, however, have thought well to give the possibility to automatically close the window every time you insert a smiley face. Click on the Devices item. Move to the Typing section using the left side menu. Scroll down and click on the Advanced keyboard settings option. Activate or deactivate the option Do not close the panel automatically after an emoji has been entered. Once this is done, you can enter all the emojis you want when you write any message with your computer. As an alternative to the combination of keys seen previously, you can take advantage of the Windows virtual keyboard. It allows you to add the same emojis present in the panel completely dedicated to them. To enable the virtual keyboard, you must click with the right mouse button on the taskbar and click on the Show virtual keyboard button item. Once this is done, a new icon will appear at the bottom right next to the battery indicator. Click on the appearance icon to open the virtual keyboard. At this point, you just have to click on the face on the left side of the space bar to be able to enter all the emoji you want. We remind you that emoji are simple characters and not image files. For this reason, the graphics of the various emojis sent depends on the operating system used by the recipient.
With its bold veining, endless colors and durability, granite has been the star of kitchens for the past 10- 15 years. Though it does its job well and continues to look great for years to come, granite countertops have decreased in popularity with the rise of alternative options. From natural soapstone to high-tech laminate countertops, there are new materials available for every kitchen that strays away from the been-there-done-that granite option. Let's take a peek at a few alternatives that still provide the durability, function and beauty we all love to see in a kitchen countertop. Quartzite is a natural stone produced when sandstone is pressure-cooked in the earth's crust. The end result is a beautiful stone with a wide variety of streaks, patterns and rich colors. Some varieties, like Taj Mahal and Mother of Pearl, offer a similar look to traditional marble without as much maintenance and upkeep. Quartzite can withstand heat, but not for an extended time, so make sure to use trivets for prolonged exposure. Though slightly more durable than granite, some quartzite does still require sealing once or twice a year for stain resistance so make sure to check with your stone fabricator on the details, as it varies by type. The beauty of quartzite is all its variations: vein-cut styles look more contemporary and sleek, while cross-cut styles have a more organic feel. Depending on the fabrication, expect your quartzite countertops to start from $80 per square foot and up. Used in laboratories due to its resistance to stains, bacteria and chemicals, there's no wonder soapstone is becoming an increasingly popular choice for homeowners looking for a durable, natural countertop. Always a dark charcoal or almost black color, its non-porous, honed surface can both hide and repel dark stains while still remaining slightly soft to the touch. Soapstone is a great choice for those who love to cook and households with little sticky fingers, as it's unaffected by heat and easy to wipe clean. Keep in mind that like any natural stone, soapstone can chip and scratch. It also darkens over time, but sanding can easily return it to a lighter shade. Starting at $80-100 per square foot, soapstone is a slightly more expensive choice over granite, but it comes with a lifetime of durability. Also known as "engineered quartz," quartz composite is a material comprised of crushed quartz and polymer binders that are tinted and compressed under high pressure. The end result is a surface that is non-porous and resistant to stains, scratches and heat. Even better, a simple wipe with warm water and soap is all you'll need to worry about in regards to maintenance. Because it is a manufactured material, quartz composite is consistent with color and patterns. This durable countertop material does come at a price—around $90-110 per square foot installed. High-pressure molded plastic countertops—who would have thought that these would be a durable and long-lasting alternative to granite? Laminate countertops are a blend of acrylic or polyester resins, powdered fillers and pigments. This unique mix allows for easy buffing of scratches and marks and its surface keeps stains away. The beauty of laminate countertops is their unique ability to be molded into unusual shapes and sizes, which works especially well in sleek, state-of-the-art contemporary kitchens. Because this material is plastic, it is sensitive to prolonged heat exposure, so make sure to use trivets and cutting boards to extend the longevity of the countertop. These high-tech countertops start at around $50 per square foot installed. What granite alternatives have you used in your kitchen? ***Guest Blog by Kerrie Kelly. Interior designer Kerrie Kelly is an expert on countertop materials in the kitchen and writes about her knowledge for The Home Depot. If you are interested in researching many of the materials Kerrie discusses in her article, you can visit Home Depot's countertops page online. With almost all of my clients, the toughest part of designing a kitchen is choosing the countertop. As manufacturing technology grows, so do the number of choices—each with its own set of pros and cons. The decision really comes down to how you live and work in your own kitchen. Let's cut to the chase with our top six countertop choices—in order of my own preference. Quartz: Also called engineered or manufactured stone, this is the surface I install in the most homes—and the reasons are simple. It's available in so many patterns and colors, is very simple to clean, and is more resistant to heat, scratches and stains than almost any other surface. It requires no sealing or treating over time. Best of all, my clients are always surprised that it's no more expensive than granite. Dekton: This is the new super surface brought to you by modern technology. Its ultra-compact surface means it's non-porous, and extremely resistant to heat and drastic changes in temperature—not to mention scratches, chips and stains. For durability, you can't do better. Colors and patterns are catching up with other options on the market. You will pay a bit more per square foot, but you will not regret it. Natural Stone: Though this category includes marble, lime and soapstone, we're really talking about granite here. Its natural beauty is simply undeniable, which makes it the other big favorite among my clients. As it has proven in nature since the beginning of time, it's very durable and heat resistant. Because it's porous, it just needs to be sealed when it's installed (and will need some resealing over the years), but the effort there adds real stain resistance to the list of its benefits—not to mention real value to the home that will never go out of style. Stainless: I often envy the simplicity of stainless steel when we install it. So clean and simple, its industrial-grade durability is completely antibacterial, and stain and heat resistant. Even scratches really blend in over time. Surprisingly, installation takes this one to the higher end of the cost scale, but it's also very flexible in terms of design. It brings a cool edge to a more traditional kitchen and can even soften the edge of an ultra contemporary style. Wood: Wood is pretty straightforward in terms of pros and cons. It's very budget friendly, and most of my clients who choose it do so knowing that its imperfections only add to its beauty, over time. Scratches and burns can even become part of the charm. However, if you treat it with oil a few times a year, it's a very durable and practical choice, too. Remember, it's available in many grains and stains, and you don't necessarily need butcher block thickness to get the same great look. Laminate: Laminate countertops can't be beat if budget is the primary factor. Available in a wide array of colors and patterns, you can go with bold, bright, primary colors or choose a finish that replicates stone and wood. It's made with a sheet of resin laid over particle board and is resistant, though not impervious to heat, stains and scratches. It is easy to clean and easy to repair.

Over our next three blogs we take the mystery out of these three simple topics, enabling you to set your styling routine up to perfection. It's a common misconception that there are many different hair types, this is largely due to the vast amount of different hair products on the market for all hair types. In fact, most people's hair will fall into one of only four hair types, and one of only three hair thickness types. The checklist below will help you to define your own hair type so that you may chose the correct product for your hair. This is hair that has no curve or bend in it at all. A slight shape to the hair but not enough to be curly. With an S shape and holds a definite curl pattern even when not styled. The hair is tightly coiled, often with a definite S or Z pattern. It can be stretched out and will return to its curled shape when released. Once you have assessed your own hair and put it into one of the above 4 categories, you will then need to decide on the thickness of your hair. One of the easiest ways to find out which of these 3 categories your hair will fall into, is to firstly wash and dry your hair and ensure no product is applied, then part it with a comb and look at the scalp where you have parted the hair. Hair that has medium density and medium volume. If you can see a little bit of scalp then your hair is medium thickness. Hair that is dense and heavy. If you can hardly see any scalp then your hair is thick. Now that you can identify your hair type, finding the correct product for your hair will be a lot easier and your hair will look much better as a result. One of the main reasons your hair generally looks great when you leave the barbershop and not quite as sharp when you try to replicate it at home is due to your barber knowing your hair type and using a product that's suitable for your hairstyle. Don't be afraid to ask your barber for advice on hair type, hair styles and what products to use to get the best results. They will also advise you when picking a hairstyle, showing them a picture will also help as they know what styles will work for your hair type and which ones won't. If you'd like bespoke advice tag @officialclosedonmonday in a recent photograph of yourself on Instagram and we'll respond in the comments.
As fashion and its industry become more fashionable than ever, it's unsurprising that people want to know more about it. There's a real thirst for expertise, insight, insider stories and an understanding of the inner workings of it all. And of course, to be part of it.
The host practice Educational Supervisor will receive a reduced (33%) trainer's grant for hosting a LEET trainee. From a clinical point of view, the ES will continue to support their trainee as they would an ST3 trainee, including on the eportfolio. In conjunction with the LEET, the mentor needs to produce a timetable of project work and supervision, to be drawn up within the first month of starting the post and submitted to the LEET, TPD or APD for approval. Host practices need to provide a proposed timetable for the trainee to show how their week would be structured. Clinical work should not be undertaken at less than 10-minute consultations. Training practices should provide a 1-2 hour CPD session per week. This should include time for face-to-face tutorials and problem case analysis. This time should be aimed at developing the trainee's PDP, including teaching them higher-level management; setting up a quality improvement project or running of a QoF area or practice team. The practice would also be expected to provide clinical support when required. The ESRs should take place as normal every 6 months. The WPBA expectation is halved for the clinical components (50% of the time is in clinical practice), however overall engagement should be the same as that of an ST3 and will therefore include significant events etc. These are then taken in combination as evidence of them having engaged satisfactorily in the project component of their job plans, and can be used by the ARCP at each review. Please see the LEET timeline for expectations. LEET Leadership Mentors should support the LEETs to seek out and achieve as many of the opportunities (as listed on the main page) as they can. They should support the LEET in the development of their major project. External Leadership Mentors can claim backfill to allow support of the LEET (up to 33% of a trainer's grant), subject to approval by the local APD. The LEET leadership mentors will need to complete a modified Clinical Supervisor's Report (CSR) prior to the 6-month and 10-month Educational Supervisors Review (ESR). These ESRs are used by the ARCP panel (Annual Review of Competence to Progress) – the process that checks up on satisfactory training completion. Asking the LEET leadership mentor to do a CSR is analogous to a hospital consultant completing a CSR for a trainee's hospital post. The GP Educational Supervisor uses this paperwork as evidence that the trainee has made satisfactory progress for this element of training. For the LEET programme, a modified CSR should be used. You can print this CSR template.
THE FASHION DADDY WELCOMES YOU! This fashionable and stylish blog is a collage of creative fresh ideas, filled with educated opinions, packed with flexible suggestions, stuffed with a lot of sense of humor and most of all, it is a place where people who enjoy fashion and style can use it as a resource, a channel to let out their passions or frustrations, a virtual mechanism to influence others with individualism and creativity. Anyone can use this blog to break the monotony of your lives—to have a good laugh or to initiate a thought. And if your life feels monotonous spice it up with a tiara or a new belt or a hat. This blog is not supposed to be the fashion police [never] because who can compete with Joan Rivers. This blog is not a serious literary document; instead, it is a fun registry about what we like to wear, our personal style and a life that's unique, fun and imaginative. WARNING: This blog is not your average and stereotypical blog, this blog offers honesty, choices, fun ideas and a good time. Criticism is welcomed. Cynicism is encouraged! Yves Saint Laurent--Inimitable I just finished watching for the fifth time in 4 years, the 2004 haute documentary about the legendary French fashion designer Yves St. Laurent. Yves St. Laurent: His Life and Time, by David Teboul is a personal look into the life and times of this iconic—the finest, fashion designer. Personal note-I had the great pleasure of meeting Monsieur St. Laurent in the fall of 1993 when I was living in Paris. It was a great honor and a humbling experience to meet the man who gave women "Le Smoking" tuxedo; the first designer to use black models in his runway shows, the originator of the shoulder strap bag (not the tote bag), and the man responsible for bringing other ethnic societies as a source of inspiration to fashion. His fashion designs have left an inimitable mark in the firmament of what is the fashion universe. His Mondrian dress stands alone in the cosmos of innovation and artistic interpretation of pop art; his safari jacket still remains a key item in women's wardrobes from Paris to New York, to Moscow and the vast landscape that makes up the stylish and fashionable macrocosm. And let's not forget the pea coat. Pierre Boulat/Lancaster/Express/Getty Images (Hulton Archives) In this provocative documentary we get a close look at how this master of haute couture began; his relationships with all those around him, most specifically with his partner Pierre Bergé and his right hand woman Loulou de la Falaise. We also get to intimately witness the creative world in which this masterful provocateur creates, produces and lives his fashion. "Ravishing," "ideal," "divine" and "sensational" are some of the statements St. Laurent and his most trusted friends and colleagues exclaim over and over throughout the film. The same adjectives can be used to describe the work and the life of one of the finest couturiers of the 20th century. It is extraordinary to watch St. Laurent carefully craft the most beautiful and wearable clothes; some of which are true classic standards which defined an era and will remain constant reference for the next generation of fashion designers. Incredible as it may sound, St. Laurent began his long career at the age of 17 when he was hired to be Christian Dior's assistant and who four years later (1958) after the sudden death of Dior became the creative mind of such prolific and perpetual couture house. In the film we are able to examine the kind of friendships St. Laurent cultivated and who he considered important, valuable and undeniably trusted confidants. We are guests to the most refined and theatrical fittings; we are told over and over that St. Laurent is like no other and his fashions are relics in the pantheon of fashion. "This dress is ravishing Georgette," he exclaims to his right hand assistant. "Thank you monsieur," timidly, yet gratefully she accepts a compliment from the master. Like this exchange there are many—many that are deserved and worth attributing. Le Smoking by Helmut Newton, Vogue 1975 Fall-Winter 83/84 Ensemble, Metmuseum.org His loyal friend, collaborator and muse, Loulou de la Falaise ever present, suggesting, admiring, protecting and loving him. I wish I had a loyal and loving friend like Mademoiselle de la Falaise. Their friendship was neither fiction nor a sham; it was real and genuine. Catherine Deneuve unselfishly and tenderly remained his true friend and muse for several decades—their collaboration(s) started in 1966 when he dressed Deneuve in the Luis Buñuel film Belle de Jour. We are invited to listen to his older sister tell stories about her beloved brother. "He was critical of what I wore from an early age," she reminisces "he knew from the age of three that he wanted to be a fashion designer," she tells. It is obvious even to the uneducated eye that his talent was grandiose and that his fascination for the dramatic-theatrical influenced his career. Saint Laurent's work influenced me greatly when I attended design school. How could he not? His work is undeniably like no other before him and timeless. His simple silhouettes and shapes that give reference to a masculine self and the refined tailoring—in his work you can see his influences too, the sculptural drama of Cristobal Balenciaga and the opulent romanticism of Christian Dior and the fabulous sensibility of Nina Ricci, which are exclusive qualities young designers these days look up to for potential design success. The Mondrian dress defined an era. Metmuseum.org Whatever your opinion might be of this the last couturier or if you don't know much or nothing at all about his life and times, this documentary will educate you and inspire you very much. I wish it could be longer, unfortunately, it is what is. Yves St. Laurent was a timid, shy person who lived a life filled with a lot of success and who throughout his career he maintained the highest standards for tailoring and for classic cut. His influence in the world of fashion and culture in general, will serve as the trademark for quality, creativity and aesthetic refinement. Now that I have offered you a glimpse about who Yves Saint Laurent was—a tremendous talented man, get to Netflix or Amazon and get yourself a copy of the documentary. You might really enjoy it. Actually, you will enjoy it greatly. You might be inspired and you might walk away more informed. Now I have to go and read a bunch of magazines to educate myself more and pass the legacy on to all of you.

Using chalk, artists create a temporary gallery of art. Many of the artists are highly adept at creating three-dimensional (3-D) illusionist paintings. Expect to see many colorful — and some not-so-colorful but always creative — works at the Lake Worth Street Painting Festival. / Katy Lynch This annual event — this year marks its 25th anniversary — attracts more than 100,000 visitors. During the festival, which begins at 10 a.m. both days, Lake and Lucerne Avenues — the main routes through downtown — are closed to vehicle traffic between Dixie Highway (U.S. 1) and Federal Highway. Admission is … free! The event also features music on the Cultural Plaza Mainstage, a food court, vendors, the Children's Meadow, and plenty of restaurants and shops on Lake and Lucerne Avenues. Proceeds from the nonprofit festival help to fund the event; in addition, they benefit the Street Painting Festival Scholarships. These are awarded each May to Palm Beach County graduating high-school students, as well as to community projects associated with the arts.

The Cardinals have signed wide receiver Kendall Wright, here catching a pass for the Bears last season. In an effort to help a passing offense -- and an offense in general -- that has struggled through five games of the season, the Cardinals signed veteran wide receiver Kendall Wright Monday to a one-year contract. To make room on the roster, the Cards released rookie cornerback Deatrick Nichols. "I've been in a lot of offenses so it's not hard to pick it up," Wright said. "The stuff they are running here, I've done it before." Wright had recently visited for a workout. Wright spent the first five seasons of his career in Tennessee, posting a 94-reception, 1079-yard season in 2013. Last year he played in 16 games for the Bears, making 59 catches for 614 yards and a touchdown. In his career, he has 339 receptions for 3,858 yards and 19 touchdowns. He was with the Vikings in the preseason but was cut prior to the regular season. He said he's been working out at a Lifetime Fitness twice a day while out of the league, catching passes from fellow free agent Landry Jones. "It's good to be back in a facility," Wright said. "It's been real weird. It'd probably be different if I felt like I can't play the game anymore, but I know I've got a lot left and I know I can play. It was hard just watching football on Sundays. If I wasn't watching some of my friends, I didn't really care about watching." Wright also said he doesn't have strong feelings that the Cardinals were playing the Vikings Sunday. "I mean, if I play I'll try to kill them, but it doesn't mean that much," Wright said. "It'll be a good game, and I can help them with the DBs and safeties after spending all training camp with them." In five games, the Cardinals have generated only 786 yards through the air. Rookie Christian Kirk is the team's leading receiver with 19 catches for 234 yards and a touchdown. Larry Fitzgerald has 17 receptions for 176 yards. Quarterback Josh Rosen was inconsistent in his second start, completing only 10 of 25 passes with many incompletions coming with open receivers that he just missed. The Cardinals also had three more drops in the game by pass catchers. Coach Steve Wilks said the offense simply needs to find more consistency. "It's not just one guy," Wilks said. "Everybody is taking their turn making that one mistake. ... Whether it it a drop by a receiver, a lineman not executing the block, a running back not hitting the right hole. "We have to make sure to correct that and get consistent in what we're doing."
Trump Makes False Claims At Georgia Rally: 'We Won The Presidential Election!' President Donald Trump took the stage in Georgia on Monday night to speak in support of Sens. David Perdue (R-Georgia) and Kelly Loeffler (R-Georgia) the night before crucial runoff elections in the state. Republican Georgia voters, however, may walk away from Trump's speech confused. Just days after Trump tweeted that the Georgia runoff elections were "invalid," in his Monday speech he said Georgians should still vote in the runoff election because "If the Left wins these Senate seats, they will abolish the Senate." The majority of Trump's stage time, however, was dedicated to continuing his … Biden promises a new era with Latin America and the Caribbean. How much can he really do?

It was one more blessings that I got an opportunity to learn Sudarshan Kriya from Pujya Guruji over the weekend. It is sometime difficult to find anything new when you have gone through many such processes. But I still managed to learn quite a few new things like the breathing excercise as directed by him which is called Sudarshan Kriya. I have been using Sri Sri products also for sometime which are actually worth trying. I managed to share something about my book series to the class mates. Also presented one to my coach who was quite helpful. I am making the best use of my time in india.

Last week, my eldest daughter asked me questions about Super Typhoon Yolanda. She told me she knew that Super Typhoon Yolanda devastated many towns in the Visayas Region and lots of families don't have houses to go home to or livelihood to start over again. Then, she asked me "What about their Christmas?" She wants to give some of her toys to the kids as a Christmas gift to them like Santa Clause. You see, children have the immense capacity to give love. They may still be young but they want to help even in their small way. It's never too early to start teaching our children to be compassionate to others. On December 1 and 8, 2013, Make Believe Productions together with Fully Booked will be having their event called "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" – a benefit especially designed for children in Manila to take part in relief efforts and express love and compassion for their young counterparts in the Visayas region, affected by Typhoon Yolanda. Our children can participate in their fun activities – interactive story telling by the Make Believe storytellers, A short discussion and sharing on the calamity and writing of letters and drawing of pictures to cheer up a friend. To make the event more special, child actress and host Hiyasmin Neri will be there on December 1 and Mike Shimamoto from Where's the Sheep will be there on December 8. Participants may bring donations in the form of clothing, blankets, easy to open canned goods, shoes, slippers, toys, and books. Children will also be given the opportunity to purchase books to include in their donations. Donations in kind will be turned over to the Villamor Relief Operations and ABS-CBN Foundation. Cash donations will also be accepted and turned over to World Vision Philippines. Somewhere Over the Rainbow will be held on December 1 and 8, 3:00 p.m., at the Children's Section of Fully Booked Bonifacio High Street. Please see the attached poster for more details. We hope you and your little ones can join us and spread the message! this is such a wonderful event! good luck..for sure the kids will be very happy for this! Sounds like a great event. I'll see if we can go. Thanks for sharing. What a nice gesture of your daughter. Keep it up! This sounds like a fun event to attend to. It's such a kind and altruistic gesture of your daughter to offer her toys to the young victims of the Typhoon Yolanda. It warms my heart how little kids can give so much love without asking anything in return. This is a very good event sponsored by Make Believe Foundation and Fully Booked. If I was in the Philippines right now, I will take my nephews and nieces to that event. You have a compassionate daughter. this sort of events are the kind i would like for me + my little man to participate. i will be sure to bring him to one of these when he gets a bit older. I believe kids are indeed full of love and so many in Youtube showed their heartache after what happened to Yolanda. This event is really something that will help the many who are in help at the same time will bring fun to children <3 Thanks for sharing! If I know anyone who can go I'll tell them about this! Sounds like a great event. Hope we can go!
Austin kicking it up a notch. This is taller than any highrise built in Texas since the 80's, and mixed-use on this scale is not something I think we've ever seen in this state. This strikes me as a 'Bank of the Southwest' type project. Overly ambitious as a result of the times and never gets built. Hope I'm wrong as this would be awesome, but it just feels that way.

Sidetracked by Dellani Oakes Part 58 Cover image from Free Stock Photos: Railroad Track On A Fall Day by Curtis Dean Wilson Eoin went to get a shower. Aaron called Jasper, giving him a brief report. He heard the water cut off in the bathroom, and saw Eoin walk to his room and fall into bed. Lying face first on the bed, Eoin lay there naked, the light on. Aaron pulled a blanket over the other man and turned out the lamp, before settling for the night. Luckily for everyone at the Partridge house, the night was quiet and uneventful. Deirdre still woke with a start, after a particularly disturbing dream, which faded as soon as she opened her eyes. Fred was curled at her side, looking so much like Aiden, she felt a lump in her throat. Somehow, the peace of the night made her more nervous. Unable to get back to sleep, she hobbled to the kitchen to get a glass of water. Tonight, Jasper was the one burning the midnight oil. He smiled up at her, offering her a cup of coffee. Since she didn't think she'd be going back to bed anyway, she accepted. "Couldn't sleep, huh?" "It's too quiet, like the calm before the storm. I had a nightmare, some faceless something was following me." She shuddered. "But it wasn't exactly running and chasing, more lurking in corners." Jasper shuddered too. "Oh, you had to say that. My worst nightmares are like that. What's sparked it, you think?" "We've put away some very bad people and solved Wendy's murder. But what I don't get is, whose idea was this? Bullock's not smart enough to do this himself. He's a great patsy, but not a lot of little gray cells to rub together." Jasper put his elbows on the table, leaning toward her. "You figure there's a master mind we didn't roll in with the others. We had pictures of all those people, lists of names…." "Yeah, but what if it's someone who never attended? Wendy would never know." "True." His nod encouraged her to go on. "It would have to be someone involved with the school. This sort of thing couldn't continue without a person to cover their tracks. But for the life of me, I can't think who." Shaking her head, she sighed. "I want to believe this is over, Jasper, but I'm simply not convinced that it is." "We've got you covered, Dee. We'll watch your family." "I know, but you can't do so forever. You have lives and families, and mine can't live like this. I learned a long time ago to stand up to my fears, but there's no one, nothing, to confront." "I wish I knew what to tell you. I guess we'll have to figure it out together." "Sooner than later." They sat and talked until the boys got up. Fred got up with them. Nadeya followed a few minutes later. She and Jasper made breakfast. It was time for the boys to go, and Deirdre hugged and kissed them all three times before she allowed them to leave. "Wow, Mom," Corin said. "We're okay. Chill, huh?" "I'll chill when you're all home safely," she said, giving him another kiss. "Ready?" Nadeya said from the living room. "Yes!" the boys said loudly. "Thanks, I'm feeling the love," Deirdre called after them. "Mom, if we were openly affectionate, you'd think we were sick," Burl said as he went out the door. "Boys!" Deirdre complained. "Who wants a game of Cards Against Humanity?" Fred suggested. "Anything to take my mind of things," Deirdre replied. She, Fred, and Jasper sat down to play. Aiden was getting weird looks from faculty and students. He wasn't entirely sure why, but figured it had something to do with Wendy's death. "So, you're the one, huh?" One of his golf team buddies accosted him in the hall between classes. "What are you talking about, Eddy?" Eddy shoved him hard. "You're the one who ratted it all out. I was counting on that scholarship!" "What they were doing was wrong, Ed. You were their whore." "I wasn't doing anything I didn't want to. So why didn't you just mind your own business?" He shoved Aiden again. "Maybe we should have arrested you along with the others," Aiden said, standing his ground. "You're so broken up about it, go cry to someone who gives a f**k. I did the right thing." "Bullshit you did!" This time, Ed took a swing.

Dambudzo Marechera, (born 1952, Rusape, Southern Rhodesia [now Zimbabwe]—died Aug. 18, 1987, Harare, Zimbabwe), Zimbabwean novelist who won critical acclaim for his collection of stories entitled The House of Hunger (1978), a powerful account of life in his country under white rule. Marechera grew up in poverty. He reacted against his upbringing and adopted an increasingly self-destructive lifestyle. He studied at the University of Rhodesia but was expelled after participating in a demonstration over the wages of black staff members. He obtained a scholarship to New College, Oxford, but he was expelled in 1977 for trying to set fire to the college building. While living in England, he wrote The House of Hunger, his name for his country. Despite critical and popular recognition brought by the publication of his book, Marechera remained disruptive and confrontational. In 1980 his novel Black Sunlight was published; less acclaimed than his first work, it is an explosive and chaotic stream-of-consciousness account of a photojournalist's involvement with a revolutionary organization. Marechera returned to Zimbabwe in 1981; his mental and physical condition deteriorated, and he was often homeless. Mindblast, or the Definitive Buddy (1984), the last collection published during his lifetime, includes four plays, a prose narrative, poetry, and a section of his Harare journal. A novel, entitled "The Depths of Diamonds," was rejected for publication reportedly because of its obscenity. Marechera's health deteriorated, and he soon died of AIDS. Posthumous publications of his works, compiled by Flora Veit-Wild, include The Black Insider (1990); Cemetery of Mind (1992), a powerful collection of his poetry; and Scrapiron Blues (1994), a collection of stories, plays, and a novella.

Print | How do I become rich? Research shows that earning lots of money is only half the work done. Spending money wisely is just as important. This can mean that even a car-loving millionaire to be will search the market for the cheapest car. However, there is another solution: a car that gives the feeling of driving a top class touring car for only a fraction of the cost. At least, that is what Hyundai promises with the new Sonata V6.

World Desk Sullivan: China Will "End Up Owning Some of The Costs" If Russia Invades Ukraine Sullivan said sanctions would impact Beijing "because they will go at the financial system of Russia which, of course, engages the Chinese economy as well." byAxios Screenshot: "Meet the Press" Two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi made a show of reinforcing their unity against Western "interference," U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the two would also be tied together in some manner if the Kremlin decides to invade Ukraine. Driving the news: "We believe that Beijing will end up owning some of the costs of a Russian invasion of Ukraine and that they should calculate that as they consider their engagements with the Russian government," Sullivan told host Chuck Todd on NBC's "Meet the Press."

Yesterday, I specifically went shopping for another thermometer. The greenhouse now has the sensor formerly in the tarp shelter. With a "cold front" moving in, I want to monitor the temperature in the tarp shelter. More than thirty plants under cover; I can't control the weather but I can protect the plants. Note the time: Four in the morning. I was wide awake for about two hours before deciding to get up and "do something." Sometimes my mind is spinning with thoughts–and plans–and I can't sleep!! Technology is so awesome!! The new thermometer automatically set itself to the correct date and time–from a satellite in the sky. So many features in that little instrument!! Walmart had it marked down from $17.88 to $10.00. I'd planned to buy another small single function (for $9.88) but couldn't resist a bargain. I believe the greenhouse is "warmer" because a much smaller space and completely closed up. By contrast, the tarp shelter is very large with lots of ventilation around the sides, and large opening for a door.

Richmond mayor to star in RCD talent show Richmond Centre for Disability is hosting its second annual RCD Got Talent fundraising event Richmond mayor Malcolm Brodie is among this year's RCD Got Talent performers The second annual RCD Got Talent fundraising show is only a week away and the organizers have a stellar cast lined up. One of the top attractions at the online show – broadcast on Richmond Centre for Disability's YouTube channel on Friday, Nov. 19 at 7 p.m. – will Richmond's mayor, Malcolm Brodie, on piano accompanying RCD's Elsa Wong on vocals. The show organizers also have the likes of a choir from Vancouver and a moms' dance group among the 10 or 11 acts lined up. RCD's Dave Thomson said he and his co-host will have multiple calls to action throughout the show to raise funds for the disability non-profit. "It's a lot of fun and, of course, it's for a good cause, so we're hoping people will come watch some of the performances," Thomson told the News. "Last year we took a flyer to see if it would work online; we were shooting for $3,000, but we made so much more, people just kept donating as the show went on." Thomson the broadcast and fundraising will be live, while the performances have been pre-recorded. "Viewers will be able to interact with us during the show and we're really looking forward to the mayor on piano with Elsa," said Thomson, adding that he's grateful to Long & McQuade for donating a keyboard for the performance.

County gridiron teams reload with All-Region honors Christmas is coming, college football is bowling and our three Region 11 football programs are busy reloading for next season. High school football never ends — especially when it comes to physical conditioning. To be more competitive, all three teams require player dedication in the weight room. Coupled with personal character and team leadership, this leads to competitive greatness which is a top priority for our county football squads. Tooele High School has nowhere to go but up and they are looking forward to the challenge. Head coach Kyle Brady is trying to herd the Buffaloes back to their winning ways and Zac Coffman will be returning to help. As a defensive back, he had 43 tackles and four sacks while on offense he had seven receptions and a touchdown. Andrew Spendlove will be returning as a tight end. He led the Buffaloes in receiving with 229 yards and two touchdowns. The defense will build off of linebacker Seth Manning, while the line will look to Tony Leakehe, another junior. THS is young and searching for a foothold in Region 11 play. The Buffaloes had one first team all region player in senior Tyler McMain. a full back and strong-side linebacker. The Buffaloes challenge is to gain some confidence and get the team moving in a positive direction. Coach Brady will find the answers and look to a more competitive season in 2012. Stansbury is reloading with a number of returning starters, including Region 11 MVP Chase Christiansen. The sophomore quarterback led the Stallions to the Region Championship rushing for 1149 yards and 19 touchdowns, while passing for an additional 527 yards and four touchdowns. He will be joined by Dacota Case, a junior running back and defensive back who also received Region first team honors collecting five interceptions this season. Both he and Christiansen are garnering other post-season accolades as Christmas approaches. The Stallions have a stable full of Region first teamers returning next season. Jackson Clausing rushed for over 600 yards and five touchdowns. Colton May lead the team with 103 tackles. Chandler Staley averaged 5.4 yards per carry along with 63 tackles. Allan Havili will anchor the line at 6'3" and weighing in at 290 pounds this season. Graduating seniors receiving first team Region honors were linemen Atu Havili and Hunter Anderson (defensive end). Stansbury's Jeremy Café was the Region Defensive MVP and is garnering other post season honors throughout the state. The 6'1", 175-pound defensive end had 27 tackles and 13 sacks his senior year. By the looks of it, Stansbury High School is in a good position to defend its title and is the team to beat in Region 11 in 2012. Grantsville High School is determined to do just that. The Cowboys are returning 18 starters next season led by team captain Skyler Cloward, who was named Region 11 Offensive MVP, which is a rare feat for an offensive lineman. Don't be fooled, he can play defense too as the linebacker amassed 96 tackles, seven sacks, one interception, caused one fumble and recovered two others, not to mention blocking a couple of punts and scoring a couple of touchdowns. The 6'1", 210 pound linebacker is all ready getting looks from in-state college football programs. Other post season awards continue to come his way as we draw near the Christmas break. Grantsville's quarterback Max Cook is a Region first teamer and is receiving other state honors as well. Cook threw for over 1000 yards and rushed for 383 yards and a couple of touchdowns. Defensively he had 43 tackles and one interception. Ky Fisher is a sophomore running back and linebacker making a name for himself as an All-Region player. Fisher rushed with 343 yards and ten touchdowns for the Cowboys while leading the team with 106 tackles. Other Region first team picks were Kelby Landon and Kaleb Ware. Landon had 34 tackles as a defensive back, while Ware averaged 4 yards a carry and had 50 tackles from his outside linebacker spot. The Cowboys say goodbye to senior offensive lineman and Region first teamer Dakota Leetham and wide receiver Dalen Erickson. Both are getting looks from college teams as well as receiving other state post-season awards. Head Coach Tony Cloward has turned the corner with a young team and a winning season. He expects more in 2012 and just by looking, the Cowboys chances seem pretty good. So there you go. Enjoy the Christmas season and make sure you give all of our county athletes heartfelt thanks when you see them. To be a successful athlete takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice. They deserve your praise! I'll see you from the sidelines.

CJM features a quirky array of Jewish T-shirts in new multimedia exhibit By David A.M. Wilensky | October 9, 2015 In a corner of the Contemporary Jewish Museum gift shop stand two wooden frames with a clothesline strung between them featuring an array of T-shirts. A blue shirt bears a Star of David-shaped version of the unmistakable red and yellow Superman "S" logo. A purple tee from Camp Ramah in Ojai announces the camp's ZIP code. A gray shirt has the OU kosher symbol on the front and reads "As Kosher as You Wanna Be" on the back — an artifact of professor Ari Y. Kelman's college years at U.C. Santa Cruz. Kelman, the Jim Joseph chair in education and Jewish studies at Stanford, discusses some of the tees in a series of video features projected onto a white sheet behind the shirts. This is "Hidden in Plain Sight! T-Shirts and the Curation of Identity," a multimedia exhibition "exploring T-shirts as canvases for meditation on contemporary identities." On display in the CJM shop through Nov. 1, the exhibit is the brainchild of Kelman, who developed it in collaboration with Sam Ball of the S.F. nonprofit Citizen Film, along with some of Kelman's grad students at Stanford. "Hidden in Plain Sight!" includes T-shirts, video and a computer. photo/david a.m.wilensky But the most interesting part of the exhibit is online. At the website www.ethnictshirts.org, you can watch each of the slickly produced videos, and everyone is invited to contribute to the exhibition by Instagramming a selfie wearing a favorite Jewish T-shirt and tagging it #ethnicteeshirts. A computer set up next to the exhibit in the museum shop allows visitors to engage with the online portion. "A lot of people stop to interact" with it, said Kevin Grenon, the store director. For those who spent their childhood, adolescence or college years attending Jewish programs — and whose closets were at some point overflowing with Jewish tees — the very idea of T-shirts as ethnic or religious identity is immediately evocative. But the concept goes way back. "When immigrant Jews arriving in the United States wanted to fit in, one of the first things they changed was their clothes," Kelman writes on the website. "Today, we curate our individual and collective identities every time we get dressed. For the majority of Jews, who 'pass' as ethnically white, wearing T-shirts bearing Jewish messages calls attention to an identity that might otherwise be invisible." On Instagram, 10-year-old Solly appears wearing a 2009 Camp Tawonga staff shirt. "Camp Tawonga is one of my favorite places in the world. At Tawonga, I feel connected to nature and Judaism," he says. Instagram user zanykirz posted an image of a black T-shirt that reads "A challah in the oven," with the comment, "Maternity tee from my mother-in-law that announces and connects my enormous life changes with my Jewish identity." Another from zanykirz: "Tee from Sukkot sleep out for the homeless at UVA Hillel, where I learned to connect Jewishness with how I acted in the world." In one video, Kelman talks about a shirt that depicts actor John Goodman as Polish-American Jewish convert Walter Sobchak from the Coen Brothers film "The Big Lebowski," which has a huge cult following, especially among younger Jews. The shirt quotes Goodman's most famous line from the movie, "I don't roll on Shabbas," which comes up in an argument about a bowling league game that has been scheduled for a Friday night. "The decision between observing the laws of his bowling league and observing the laws of the Sabbath is a kind of classic Jewish dilemma between holding to a set of religious beliefs and a desire to participate in American culture more broadly," Kelman says in the video. "Walter's dilemma has made him a particularly beloved character to Jewish fans of the film." Several of the shirts featured in the exhibit are on sale in the museum store. Grenon lamented that they can't sell all of the shirts in the exhibit because of copyright. His favorite, however, is on sale; it looks like it might be from Yosemite National Park, but it actually says, "Yo Semite." "Hidden in Plain Sight!" is on exhibit through Nov. 1 at the Contemporary Jewish Museum store, 736 Mission St., S.F. Free. www.thecjm.org David A.M. Wilensky David A.M.

You can see it on the horizon, but you're too busy to address it right now. You're juggling life – a family, full-time job, pets, financials and everything else that goes with it. So when spending time with your aging parents, you probably can't imagine incurring something the size of their waning independence. And so it's easy to let it go, for now. But the hard reality remains: most Americans do not have a plan for their aging loved one. When the problem with Mom or Dad worsens, many families endure the chaos and stress of trying to find a solution. It doesn't have to be this way. Don't wait any longer. Find peace of mind by preparing yourself for what's ahead. The first step toward maintaining your aging parent's well-being is to come up with a plan of care. With each passing year, your elderly parent may only require more assistance. A trusted caregiving agency can give an honest and experienced perspective on what to expect. Planning early for Mom or Dad will help you make better decisions. Your elderly mom or dad make up the 'silver tsunami' dramatically impacting the demographics of the nation. "The number of Americans ages 65 and older is projected to more than double from 46 million today to over 98 million by 2060, and the 65-and-older age group's share of the total population will rise to nearly 24 percent from 15 percent," according to Population Reference Bureau. Aging parents face a higher chance of developing memory difficulties like dementia or Alzheimer's. "Demand for elder care will also be fueled by a steep rise in the number of Americans living with Alzheimer's disease, which could nearly triple by 2050 to 14 million, from 5 million in 2013," per the Population Reference Bureau. You want the best for your mom and dad, so it's time to think about how to address the challenge of caring for them when they can no longer care for themselves. The plan must be sustainable and realistic. Daily pressures from your work and personal life will prevent you from adequately addressing the needs of an aging parent. You're already a mom to growing children, a wife and a worker. When assuming the role of family caregiver to your elderly loved one, you represent the sandwich generation. You're dealing with extra emotional, financial and legal stress. According to 'Caregiving in the U.S.' by the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP Public Policy Institute, "On average, caregivers spend 24.4 hours a week providing care to their loved one. Nearly one-quarter provide 41 or more hours of care a week (23%)." Don't risk exposing yourself to dangerous burnout. Instead, a professional caregiver has the training to offer daily assistance to mom or dad. You can also rely on the caregiver to give you much-needed respite care. A professional caregiver provides non-medical support for your aging parent. This person is a fully-trained professional. Compassion and patience underscore quality caregiving at home. When your mom or dad needs help with grooming, dressing, or preparing meals, the professional caregiver serves as the solution. The dedicated hire can also provide medication reminders, so your aging parent won't forget. The benefits of the professional caregiver include better health and potentially lower medical bills for your parent. "Elderly Americans receiving home care generally need fewer trips to doctors and hospitals. As a result, home care reduces overall health care costs…" according to the joint report by the Home Care Association of America and Global Coalition on Aging. As your elderly loved one ages, it's essential to keep stimulating his or her cognitive and social abilities. The friendly professional caregiver can energize your aging parent. This person is trained to support the emotional, physical and spiritual needs of the elderly. The professional caregiver offers a host of care services that can including teaching mom or dad the basics of texting, surfing the internet and social media. Your aging loved one won't feel lonely or depressed. Instead, Mom or Dad will learn how to stay connected with you and the world. Older people fall every second of every day, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The likelihood of a fall increases with age, up to 37 percent in people 85 years or older. So, it's smart to hire a professional caregiver to prevent a fall before it happens to Mom or Dad. You will get a thorough assessment of the risk factors. Meanwhile, the professional caregiver provides customized care for Mom or Dad experiencing dementia or Alzheimer's. Your aging parent can avoid dangerous situations like keeping the stove on or getting lost while going to the grocery store. It's natural to worry about your aging loved one; however, you can feel good knowing a professional caregiver is present, especially if you live a distance from Mom or Dad. Long-distance services give you the option to send care when you can't be there. Planning now for your elderly loved one will save you from panic, guilt and stress. Don't wait for the dizzying chaos of a parent's life event that changes everything. Planning for home care services right now can save you from having to react to an incident, but instead allow a plan your family made to unfold as it should. Click here for more ways to be proactive, including knowing the signs of decreased independence of which you cannot ignore. You were such a comfort to me and my grandmother before her death. Your caregivers are a godsend!

After 5 or 6 visits to this years display it was finally quiet enough to photograph it. This years theme is a lot more traditional than in recent years. See the sidebar for links to previous years displays. Three short video clips of Fenwicks Christmas window display. I had to be there at 8 in the morning to be able to get anywhere near it as every other visit I made it was just too busy. The window always seems to kick off the christmas frenzy in Newcastle. Congratulations to you for posting these great photos and videos of Fenwick's wonderful Christmas Window this year. Further, a hearty "Thank You" to Fenwick's for returning to the real Christmas. Alternative stories can be fun, but...Hey!...It Is Christmas!! Many thanks for posting these photos and videos. Its my only way og seeing the fenwicks window , as I now live in New Zeakand . Thanks for the great photos, I love seeing them each year.
I served my last day at the Bank last October 30, 2009 -- after exactly two years and two months of working for one of the country's largest private commercial banks. To the people who know what I've been through at the office, this is one of the happiest days of my life. I was in a state of bliss indeed. Why wouldn't I be, at least I'd be out of the rut where I (and my colleagues) seem to have been "stuck." Whew, at last I wouldn't have to put up with ridiculous (and mostly irrational) screaming fits anymore. Plus, my days of praying for miracles are over. That easy. Or is it? Well, honestly-speaking it's not. It's almost, how do you describe that, bittersweet? On one hand, you're happy and relieved. On the other, you suddenly feel saddened. The two weeks leading to my last day were the most "critical." Suddenly, the reality that you are already saying goodbye to your dearest friends is already sinking in. Admittedly, I am one of those persons who are almost in torment when muttering the word goodbye. What I didn't like the most was the fact that I'd get nostalgic almost every minute. Thoughts (happy, of course) randomly pop up in my head. Sometimes, I feel that a good cry (and maybe a nervous breakdown) is the only option. To better describe it, the feeling was so low that I entertained the thought of revoking my resignation. Though obviously I didn't do that. As the days passed, and my "big day" approached nearer, I began to feel a certain peace. Like acceptance, as illustrated in the Kubler-Ross model of grief, wherein you begin to, well, admit the fact that one phase of your life has ended and you are about to tread a new journey. There are uncertainties, for sure, wherever that destination may be. It might not even be as prospective or even as obliging as the previous territory but, similar to others who have been through near-trauma experiences, I just want to get out, move forward, and start anew. A leap of faith, so to speak. In any case, I'm just hopeful that this new voyage wouldn't be as turbulent. With renewed faith and optimism, I'm looking forward to counting better days as I live out each moment.
Letter of the Day: A better electoral method By dailybreeze | dailybreeze@dfmdev.com | PUBLISHED: July 26, 2011 at 12:00 a.m. | UPDATED: September 6, 2017 at 8:08 a.m. A better electoral method The Daily Breeze conducted a reader poll on how California should award its electoral votes but neglected to include the congressional district method, in which the majority winner in each district would win one electoral vote for that district. The candidate who wins the majority of the popular vote statewide wins the two electoral votes representing the two senators. This option has the following advantages: 1. Every electoral vote would be in play. Each voter in the state would be better represented. Republican voters in the central and eastern parts of the state could contribute toward awarding their candidate some electoral votes. 2. Political candidates would be more inclined to campaign in California, which up to now has been all but guaranteed to the Democratic candidate for the past 20 years. 3. Voter turnout would increase, since more voters would feel that their vote actually counted. 4. In the event that there has to be a recount, tallying could focus on specific congressional districts in dispute as opposed to a burdensome canvassing of the entire state. – Arthur Christopher Schaper, Torrance dailybreeze
How Pipedrive saved 350 hours (and counting) on talent relocation Pipedrive went from having constant issues with local authorities to saving hundreds of hours on talent relocation. Relocation and Immigration Services https://www.pipedrive.com/ Founded in 2010, Pipedrive is a tool built by salespeople for salespeople to manage intricate or lengthy sales processes. The company today is 77th on the Forbes Cloud 100 list, covers more than 170 countries and 16 languages, and has 500+ employees across eight offices in six countries. That's a lot of numbers to squeeze into one sentence. The point is, they're everywhere. And they're hiring a lot—also from everywhere. Rocky beginnings When Pipedrive first started relocating people to their Estonian HQ in 2015, it wasn't exactly smooth sailing. "We were having difficulties understanding the legal system in Estonia," says Girli Moks, People Operations Team Lead at the Tallinn office. "And we had some problems when communicating with the Police and Border Guard Board. It happened really often that we wanted to relocate a candidate or a new employee to Estonia and we thought that maybe it would take a month or two, but actually it ended up taking three or four months." But there was no turning back. The floodgates were open. Because hiring internationally is inevitable for a company like Pipedrive. "Although we have a lot of great talent here, it's not really meeting the actual demand of our company," says Mirjam Laurisaar, Talent Acquisition Team Lead. "There aren't enough specialists on the local market." So the writing was on the wall—they needed a helping hand. Team Pipedrive had their hesitations about bringing on a relocation partner. They worried about whether Jobbatical had enough knowledge and people to get the job done fast. "We didn't know how long it would take for Jobbatical to get our new employees here," Girli remembers. "Will we need to chase them? But actually they ended up chasing us with different questions, so it was a really surprisingly good service." 70+ relocations later, they're glad they took a chance on Jobbatical. Because that translates roughly to 350 hours of work saved. Plus a lot of happy new hires. "From the moment that we know we want to move a candidate to Estonia for the final interview, they take it over from the recruiter and they start to compose all the documents and residence permits and visas," Girli describes their cooperation with Jobbatical. "In Estonia, they also help our relocated employees find family doctors and register their address." When boring is a good thing And just like that, Pipedrive went from constant communication issues with local authorities to being able to offer their hires the smoothest relocation experience around. You know you've got a good thing going when even the most potentially challenging relocation cases turn out… well, kind of boring, actually. For Girli, the most memorable case was a fresh hire from Indonesia. A lot of room for disastrous mishaps here, as there's no Estonian embassy in Indonesia. "So the employee had to go to the Chinese embassy to apply for a Chinese visa, then to China to apply for an Estonian visa," Girli recalls. "Then after that, he could come to Estonia. The process had to be very well thought through. And Jobbatical managed it very well, so everything went fine." The relocation case that stands out for Mirjam is also memorable mostly for how shockingly uneventful it was. Same old story: new hire moving from Iran. No Estonian embassy. Things could have gone spectacularly wrong… and then didn't. "I was just baffled by the fact that the whole process was so smooth," Mirjam says. "It went really fast, we didn't have any hurdles whatsoever. Also, it was the first Iranian person we've had here at Pipedrive, so it was a milestone for me and the company." Stop and celebrate the diversity Being able to take a moment to appreciate the milestones is one of the happy side effects of trusting experts with relocation paperwork. Instead of getting caught up in the red tape and putting out fires, you can afford to save your energy and excitement for the big-picture stuff. Pipedrive, for example, gets excited about the immense value of having an international team. "We strongly believe in diversity," Mirjam says. "Having people from different backgrounds, different cultural experiences enforces this very strong company culture that we have by bringing on diverse ideas." With around 45 nationalities represented, Pipedrive really is a true melting pot. And the benefits of that extend far beyond the bottom line of the business. "We get to learn from each other's cultures," Mirjam says. "We are growing as human beings. I truly believe that people from different backgrounds, when you bring them together into one room, into one team, something wonderful happens. Much better ideas are being brought to life." Girli couldn't agree more. "With hiring from abroad and having this very diverse culture at Pipedrive, I have understood that there is no way that is always the only correct way. You can do and see things from a different angle and it will still be the correct angle, even if it's not the same as your friend or coworker has." "We are super happy with Jobbatical, so definitely recommend to everyone. If I would have to put a number behind it, then definitely 10/10. We're very satisfied, we very much appreciate the support that you guys are giving us." — Mirjam Laurisaar, Talent Acquisition Team Lead More customer success stories How Typeform used Jobbatical to simplify their talent relocation process How Hellotickets found a holistic solution to talent relocation
Pakistan trio await spot-fixing verdict Published Saturday, February 05, 2011 Accused Pakistan cricketers Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Aamer were awaiting a sporting tribunal's ruling on spot-fixing allegations against them Saturday. The charges relate to alleged incidents during a Test match against England at Lord's last year, when Britain's News of the World tabloid claimed the players were willing to deliberately bowl no-balls. A three-man International Cricket Council (ICC) anti-corruption tribunal, which deferred a decision after a six-day hearing last month, began proceedings in Doha at 9.00 am local time (0600 GMT). The tribunal is headed by Michael Beloff QC, while the other two members are Albie Sachs of South Africa and Sharad Rao of Kenya. Aamer's lawyer Shahid Karim said that a set procedure would be followed. "We understand that written verdicts are given to the players and the ICC by the tribunal first. If they are found guilty the lawyers and players will debate on the possible sanctions," Karim told AFP. If found guilty the minimum punishment the tribunal can impose is a five-year ban, with a life bar the maximum. Separately the trio, along with British-based agent Mazhar Majeed, were charged by Crown Prosecution Services (CPS) in London on Friday. Karim said: "I am surprised and shocked by the CPS announcement. A day before the ICC tribunal verdict, the CPS announcement has changed the scenario in the case." All three players, who are currently suspended from international cricket, have repeatedly denied the allegations and have expressed confidence they will resume their careers.

Asheboro man flies planes without leaving the ground By Larry Penkava lpenkava@courier-tribune.com Twitter: @larrypenkavaCT ASHEBORO — Imagine you're flying in a single-engine turboprop from Charlotte to Tangier Island, Va. You're sitting in the captain's seat watching a myriad of dials, buttons and switches while clouds swirl around and the Piedmont terrain passes below. The plane is the ultramodern Carenado Daher Socota TBM 850, one of the smallest turboprops made, but highly engineered. Tim Garris has flown more than 1,000 passengers from Charlotte to Tangier Island, Va., in this plane and he hasn't charged any of them a dime. Although he is a licensed pilot with instrument ratings, Garris has found his passion in flying while remaining on the ground. He designs flight simulation videos for his own Youtube channel, FS MaNiA. An Asheboro designer/builder by day, Garris spends much of his free time creating simulated flights in various aircraft, from space-age corporate jets to low-tech propeller planes. His aim is to make the videos seem as real as actual flight. "I've been doing this since the first flight simulators came on a floppy drive," Garris said from his home office with a desk that looks suspiciously like a cockpit. "I got a copy and played with it." Early on in flight simulation, he said, Microsoft had a team working on the programs. "They gave a platform to build on. There was great visual representation, navigation aids and aircraft from small planes to (Boeing) 747s." When Microsoft realized their customer base was limited to a small niche community of enthusiasts, the company dropped flight simulation, Garris said. It took a handful of those passionate about flight simulation to pick up the slack. "A lot of very smart people have built on what Microsoft started," he said. "One company develops heavy aircraft, like the 747." Other people develop add-on systems such as weather conditions, realistic terrain and views of various airports, all of which "ups the experience." Garris said the flight simulation "community stepped in to support the platform. Others stepped in to work on new platforms. "You have to know a lot about computers to build a flight simulator," he said. "If you're willing to invest the time, the reward is the fruit of being able to fly any aircraft to any airport. You can buy a basic platform plus add-ons." Garris said a flight simulation platform is "so sophisticated it takes a thick manual, pretty much the same as with a real aircraft. They model all the systems." Regulars in the flight simulation community can post problems or helpful information concerning details in a simulated model, Garris said. His own Youtube channel receives dozens of comments from people who watch his videos. "Being a real-world pilot puts you to an elevated status, gives you more credibility," he said. "I use what I learned in my private pilot career." Garris said he took ground school at Guilford Technical Community College, then passed his instrument rating in 1996. "That's a big advantage," he said, "the kind of information needed for flight simulation." With his pilot's license, Garris continued to be checked out in larger planes to carry more people. That way he could split the cost among more passengers. He once flew to the Bahamas and split the cost four ways. Interestingly, Garris has given up real-world flying. "I always rented planes," he said. "The first was a Cessna 152 at the Asheboro airport. The last plane I flew was a Cessna 210 Centurion for over $100 an hour." One of those real-world flights was to Tangier Island, where he took some passengers to dine on soft crab sandwiches. The trip back home got kind of dicey when ice began forming on the windshield. He recalls that trip on his flight simulation video to Tangier. A typical video might be divided into three parts, with the first describing the selected aircraft and its capabilities. The second may include takeoff and much of the flight while the third segment culminates in the landing. Garris acts not only as an instructor but also as a tour guide, relating interesting facts about locations the video flies over. For instance, on the flight to Tangier, he flies over Asheboro and talks about how the regional airport was once known officially as Whiskey 44, despite the town's "dry" status. It's now called KHBI. From the video, you learn that Tangier Island is in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay, is accessible only by plane, boat or "swimming," and has a population of some 700. Its economy is based on fishing and tourism. Garris established his Youtube channel in August of 2015 and soon had 2,000 subscribers. Duties in his business kept him from developing new videos for about a year, but after he went back, his viewers grew to about 4,000. Besides using add-on programs with his platforms, Garris adds on some of his own features. He said he took a year of photography at Randolph Community College and now "spend(s) more time establishing shots to put in a story format." More recently, he said, he has begun learning all he can about air traffic control to add to videos. He tapes real-world ATC voices to use with his flight simulations, which makes it seem like he's communicating with the ground. "There are different elements to add to the experience," Garris said. "A video is the culmination of all the parts coming together. It's entertainment and education, factual and realistic. "Someone who is passionate about aviation will hang on every part of it," he said. "Either you love it or you don't. The people really tuned in are passionate. "It's amazing how sophisticated it has become," he said. "It continues to develop with new platforms and add-on software." While flight simulation is a hobby for Garris, the hobby that began in real airplanes when he was 24 years old has continued "at a relatively affordable price. "I never lost the passion."
Offset filmed himself being detained by police at a Trump rally "What is you grabbing my wrist for? That's aggressive, bro" By Jennifer Savin Gabriel OlsenGetty Images Cardi B's husband and one third of rap group Migos, Offset, live streamed himself being detained by police at a Trump rally in Beverley Hills on Saturday. The footage, which was shared on Instagram Live, shows officers approaching Offset's car and asking him to stop the engine running – a request he declined, citing the fact that officers were holding guns as the reason why. Following that, police then reached inside the car window, unlocked the driver's side door and pulled the 'Ric Flair Drip (& Metro Boomin)' hitmaker from the vehicle. In the video, he can be heard saying, "You can't just open my door like that, it's illegal. I'm going to sue the sh*t outta y'all" and later, "What is you grabbing my f*cking wrist for? [It's] aggressive, bro!" Although Offset was released after questioning from officers, Cardi B's cousin, Marcelo Almanzar, who was also travelling with him in the car, was arrested. It was later reported by The LA Times, that the Beverly Hills police department released a statement saying that officers conducted the stop after receiving a report that someone had pointed a gun from a vehicle near Santa Monica Boulevard and Beverly Drive at around 5pm. They add that Offset's license plate matched the one given by a witness. A post shared by OFFSET (@offsetyrn) The Beverly Hills PD tweeted that Almanzar was charged with carrying a concealed weapon and carrying a loaded firearm in public, and had a $35,000 bail to his name. Their statement says that Offset was not arrested and reports stating so are false. Offset's publicist also released a public comment on the incident, saying the rapper was detained following an attack by aggressive Trump supporters, adding that he was not the aggressor and that he complied despite having guns pointed at him by officers. The statement added: "Offset thanks his fans for their support and wishes everyone peace and safety during these trying times. He encourages everyone to get out and vote because nothing changes if nothing changes. "Offset's current focus is encouraging younger voters to get to the polls in order to keep incidents like this from continuously happening." Cardi B, who recently filed for divorce from Offset but has seemingly rekindled their relationship of late, also posted on social media about her experience of Trump rallies. On her Instagram Stories she shared a series of videos in which she could be seen driving through one and appeared on edge. "Nah, we gonna get jumped. I really feel like we gonna get jumped. Oh my God," she told her followers. "Trump supporters are everywhere, I'm scared, I don't like it with these big a*s trucks." Cosmopolitan UK's November issue is out now and you can SUBSCRIBE HERE.

The Progress of Olefin Metathesis: Can It Handle Every Functional Group Now? 03 March, 2015 / by SK / in Blog In January 2015, Yves Chauvin, the French chemist who was the first to propose the reaction mechanism of olefin metathesis, passed away. For his contribution, he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2005 with Robert Grubbs and Richard Schrock, who developed first well-defined catalysts. As you all know, olefin metathesis (or olefin cross-metathesis) is the reaction in which the double bonds of two different olefins can be swapped to produce a new pair of olefins. The advent of this extraordinary reaction was a major game-changer in organic synthesis, and it didn't take long until the reaction became one of the essential tools of synthetic chemists. Important modifications have been made to the original catalysts and substrate generality has improved considerably for E-selective olefin metathesis. For example, the ruthenium-based "second generation Grubbs-Hoveyda catalyst" is known as a particularly effective catalyst (shown in the figure below). On the other hand, however, Z-selective metathesis is fundamentally more challenging and the substrate scope has remained much more limited. In this context, a new example of Z-selective cross-metathesis using novel ruthenium catalysts was reported in the end of last year by the group of Amir Hoveyda of Boston College, who is one of the leaders in this field. "High-value alcohols and higher-oxidation-state compounds by catalytic Z-selective cross-metathesis" Koh, M. J.; Khan, R. K. M.; Torker, S.; Yu, M.; Mikus, M. S.; Hoveyda, A. H. Nature 2015, 517, 181. DOI:10.1038/nature14061 They were successful in obtaining olefins with high Z-selectivity for substrates containing alcohol and carboxylic acid groups, many of which had previously been either difficult or completely unviable. So what do the catalysts look like and how were they able to solve the long-standing problem? Let us take a look. Z-Selective Cross Metathesis Z-Selective cross metathesis had been very difficult as mentioned, but it was finally reported by the groups of Hoveyda and Schrock in 2011.[1] This chemistry was introduced on this website before so we'll only touch it briefly this time. As shown below, the reaction effectively produced Z-olefins from enol ethers and allylic amides by employing the molybdenum alkylidene complex. Reports of Z-selective cross-metathesis by several other groups followed it, but few of those systems were general enough to be compatible with substrates containing reactive functional groups of the likes of aldehyde and carboxylic acid. Towards solving this problem, the researchers had to reexamine the central metal atom of the catalyst. Development of the New Ruthenium Catalysts In general, molybdenum and tungsten catalysts are deactivated in the presence of unprotected oxygen-containing functional groups such as alcohol, aldehyde, and carboxylic acid. In contrast, ruthenium dichloride complexes are known to catalyze metathesis unaffected by these groups. The authors first looked at the two ruthenium complexes (Ru-2 and Ru-3a), which contain anionic ligands similar to the dichloride complexes. These complexes had been demonstrated to be effective catalysts for Z-selective homo-metathesis and ring-opening metathesis reactions.[2] Indeed, these catalysts worked for cross-metathesis of alcohol-containing substrates, and the authors ultimately found that Ru-3b, the derivative of Ru-3a, was the most active and selective. The improved catalytic activity of Ru-3b was attributed to the suppression of catalyst decomposition thanks to the introduction of chlorine atoms. For those of you who are interested in learning more about the details, we would recommend checking out the paper that explains it with DFT energy calculation. The newly developed catalyst was demonstrated to be effective not only for substrates containing alcohol, aldehyde, and carboxylic acid, but also for some sterically hindered substrates and diene substrates. The authors also applied it to the stereoselective synthesis of the substructure of natural products such as neopeltolide and leucascandrolide A. They went on to complete the total synthesis of (+)-neopeltolide.[3] In yet another application, the new catalytic system was successfully applied to the direct conversion of oleyl alcohol and oleic acid, both of which are abundant raw materials found in animal fats and vegetable oils, into high-value Z-alkene products. The system is different from previously known systems in that: 1) It does not require protecting group manipulation, and 2) The reaction proceeds at lower temperature, which leads to higher Z-selectivity. The high stereoselectivity also helps simplify otherwise-difficult separation of olefin isomers. Please check the paper for more detailed information. Well, what did you think? As said in the title, it may not be an exaggeration to say that olefin metathesis has now overcome nearly every functional group. With the expanding substrate scope, the reaction will continue to contribute to the development of organic synthesis. We are saddened by the loss of a great chemist who pioneered this field, but his legacy will always be remembered. Meek, S. J.; O'Brien, R. V.; Llaveria, J.; Schrock, R. R.; Hoveyda, A. H.

These 'Stranger Things' Season 3 Spoilers Hint At A Much Darker Future For The Series By Meghan DeMaria Stranger Things' second season hit Netflix less than a year ago, but fans are still eager to know what's next for the show. While it doesn't have a release date yet, executive producer and director Shawn Levy and actor David Harbour did reveal a few clues about Stranger Things' third season in an interview with Deadline on Thursday, July 12. The series received 12 Emmy Award nominations, including a supporting actor nomination for Harbour. Fans should be warned that according to Levy, the third season is "definitely going to yet darker still." For a show that stars a group of children, Stranger Things is already pretty dark — no child should have to undergo, say, being lost in a parallel dimension. Fortunately, Levy also told Deadline that the third season has "so much heart and humor," which will hopefully balance out the scarier and/or sadder moments ahead. After all, fans have already been introduced to Dad Steve, and it wouldn't be fair not to include more heartwarming scenes with him now. Levy also told Deadline that Stranger Things has been shooting its third season for at least a few weeks now. They're evidently doing a great job of keeping the filming hidden from any onlookers in Georgia, considering the fact that nothing's been spoiled by savvy fans yet. (There are a few leaked set photos, but they don't reveal much, other than the fact that Harbour can totally pull off printed shirts.) Harbour also provided a clue about the upcoming season. While the first two Stranger Things seasons paid homage to Steven Spielberg and Stephen King, as Harbour pointed out, the actor hinted that there will be new '80s inspiration for the third season. He told Deadline, "I would go look at the great films that were released in '85, of which there were many, and just go down that list and think of the possibilities that we could be going with. I think it is a specific season to 1985, and so you'll see references to that." Harbour didn't say which 1985 movies Stranger Things might be inspired by, but there are a lot of possibilities. If the show is taking inspiration from movies that aren't horror films or thrillers, there are plenty of movies released in '85 that might have the "heart and humor" Levy mentioned. Back to the Future, The Breakfast Club, The Goonies, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, St. Elmo's Fire, and Teen Wolf were all released that year. There's also Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. And fans will remember that the first episode of season 2 was titled "Madmax," as it was when Sadie Sink's character was introduced in the show. There's another small spoiler that fans know about Stranger Things season 3, too. Noah Schnapp revealed that the Byers' family dog, Chester, passed away. That's not the biggest spoiler, but at this point, fans will take what they can get. Stranger Things' Season 2 finale left plenty of things unanswered. The Mind Flayer is still out there, looming over the kids. And Dr. Brenner, AKA Papa, might not be dead. Eleven is safe — and adopted — but that doesn't mean the trouble in Hawkins is over. Plus, the show could still introduce fans to some of Eleven's other "siblings," who were also victims of the experiments she went through. Fans might not have seen the last of Dart. And there are still plenty of unanswered questions about Eleven's biological mom. There are any number of things that could happen in Stranger Things' next season, and it's reassuring to hear that there will be at least some humor amid all of the darkness. Until there's more information about the new season, fans will likely be happy to cheer on Stranger Things at the Emmy Awards.
When you love the look of polished concrete, but don't have the budget to accommodate it, you may be interested in the natural appeal of a 'cut and seal' coating. The back patio area of this acreage home had been painted repeatedly for a number of years, but this finish was wearing thin – literally and figuratively! The homeowners needed a simple, easy to clean surface that reflected their minimalistic lifestyle and limited budget, so a cut and seal finish was selected. The process generally involves grinding back the existing paint finish, and exposing the aggregate beneath. In this case, we struck gold: the concrete was full of colourful stones distributed evenly across the patio, in tones of grey, sienna and ochre. Small cracks were filled with a fast fix resin before the application of a highly durable clear coat with non-slip additive. The coating added a stunning level of depth to the colouring of the floor, and most importantly, made it incredibly easy to clean. If you'd like to learn more about the cut and seal system, contact us today.
'Letterman,' 'Ferguson' employees to be paid 4:00 AM PST 11/15/2007 by Paul J. Gough , AP STRIKE ZONE: LATEST NEWS AND UPDATES NEW YORK -- Strike or not, employees of "The Late Show with David Letterman" and the "Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson" will be paid through the end of the year. The programs' production company, Worldwide Pants Inc., notified its employees in New York and Los Angeles on Tuesday that they would be paid regardless of whether the show returned or not. It would make Worldwide Pants, which is owned by "Late Show" host David Letterman, the first known company to guarantee its staff a paycheck during the writers' strike. The move was made to assure employees who were concerned about making ends meet, as thousands of other employees on other shows that are being idled as the strike continues. It comes at a time when other shows, like NBC's "The Tonight Show," have told their employees to expect to be idled as the strike continues through its second week. There were rumors, since denied, that "The Daily Show" host Jon Stewart had initially guaranteed a paycheck to the writers. Unlike NBC, which owns "The Tonight Show," CBS does not own the "Late Show" or "The Late Late Show." The network pays a license fee to the production company, which it has stopped due to the strike and the fact that there are no new shows. It doesn't mean, however, that there will be no work on "The Late Show." Decisions are being made week-to-week on whether the show will return to the air in some form. The news about "The Late Show" was initially broken by the blog DeadlineHollywoodDaily.com. Paul J. Gough

The Himalayan Times > Kathmandu > Melamchi project to conduct test run of water treatment plant from next month Melamchi project to conduct test run of water treatment plant from next month Published: June 12, 2017 3:17 am On: Kathmandu Kathmandu, June 11 The Melamchi Water Supply Development Project is preparing to conduct test run of the Sundarijal-based treatment plant starting next month. The treatment plant's construction is nearing completion. Deputy Executive Director at Melamchi Water Supply Development Board Ramakant Duwadi said the board had instructed contractors to conduct a test run of the treatment plant and water supply systems. "Contractors have begun procurement of pipes to supply water from the Bagmati River to the treatment plant in Sundarijal. They have also begun construction of a small intake dam on the Bagmati River after seeking permission from the Shivapuri Nagarjuna National Park ," Duwadi told The Himalayan Times, adding that they had to seek permission as the intake lies in the buffer zone area of SNNP. Duwadi informed that the test run of the treatment plant would be conducted after water level in the Bagmati River rises. "First a test run of the treatment plant would be conducted. Then, treated water will supplied through the bulk distribution system from July," he said. Sundarijal-based plant has the capacity of treating 85 million litres of water per day. Two Indian Companies VA Tech Wabag Ltd and Pratibha Industries Ltd are working to conduct test run of the water treatment plant. PIL is the contractor for Sundarijal-based plant whereas VA Tech Wabag Ltd is the contractor for expansion of the Guheshwori-based treatment plant. Meanwhile, MWSDB said the speed of tunnel construction was yet to speed up due to weak rocks and slow excavation. Recent progress report obtained from MWSDB has shown that of total 27,584.5 metre tunnel, only 24,512.6 metre had been excavated so far. The government had earlier provided additional support after the contractor said they were unlikely to complete tunnel excavation on time without using new technology. On demand of the contractor, the government had provided an additional USD 3 million for tunnel excavation. With the third deadline fast approaching, MWSDB is struggling to complete its task on time by using the most effective technology. The third deadline for completion of the project is expiring on October 2017. However, given the pace of work, the project is likely to miss this deadline too. Started in 21 December 2000, the Melamchi Water Supply Project is a project assisted by the Asian Development Bank which aims to reduce the problems of drinking water scarcity in the Valley. The Melamchi Project envisages supplying 510,000,000 litres of water per day to the Valley from the Melamchi, Yangri, and Larke rivers of Sindhupalchowk District. In phase one, the project will supply 170,000,000 litres of water per day to the Valley. A version of this article appears in print on June 12, 2017 of The Himalayan Times.

Five Things: Raiders v Dragons Wed 10 Jul 2019, 09:37 AM The Canberra Raiders will be looking to get back to winning ways when they take on the St George Illawarra Dragons on Sunday at WIN Stadium. Here are five things to look out for: The Full 80 minutes The Raiders will be looking for another fast start this week against the Dragons but will be hoping to maintain the pressure throughout the game. Last week, Canberra had a strong first 30 minutes against the Parramatta Eels, scoring three early tries. But the momentum switched after the Eels scored two quick tries in the last five minutes of the half. Parramatta ultimately went on to score another two tries in the second half to take out the win. Time to change history The Raiders have had a tough time in recent years when they face the Dragons, only winning one out of the last six. Before this, however, the Green Machine had won nine in a row against the Dragons, scoring at least 20 points in eight out of the nine games. Canberra will be looking to break the Dragons streak and hope to start their own streak on Sunday night. Croker Milestone All eyes will be on Jarrod Croker once again, with the co-captain still one try away from being the all-time leading try scorer for the club. Jarrod is currently tied with long-time Raiders great Jason Croker on 120 tries, Jarrod is also currently coming second in scoring in the NRL this season with 128 points. The Raiders centre has also impressed when it comes to facing off against the Dragons, scoring seven tries in 13 appearances. The One Percenters Canberra this season has become the kings of dummy half runs, posting 250 runs this season. This is 47 more runs than the second-best South Sydney Rabbitohs who sit on 203. The Raiders have also impressed when it comes to the kicking game. Ricky Stuart's side is placed first in the NRL for both total kicks (333) and 40/20 kicks (3). Both stats help the Raiders gain crucial metres out of the back half of the field, leading to strong attacking positions. Post Origin Performances Canberra currently sits fourth on the ladder and wins in the final half of the season will help the Raiders secure a top-four spot. The Raiders will be looking to get essential wins in the next four weeks when they face the Dragons, West Tigers, Penrith Panthers and the New Zealand Warriors, all teams sitting outside the eight. With Origin ending this week, the Green Machine will be looking to make a strong push towards the finals.

Nilaya Productions / About Us An independent production company headed by Patricia Boutinard Rouelle, Nilaya has been active since 2011. Our films are marked by a desire to explore in depth the issues at the heart of our societies and history – to give original writing its place and trust in the public's intelligence. From archive-based documentaries to docu-fictions, from works of history to immersive films and investigations, Nilaya Productions primes diversity and liveliness. Realscreen Magazine rated Nilaya one of the 100 most influential producers. Our films are broadcast on all French channels, but also internationally (Curiosity Stream, NAT GEO, YLE, DR, RTS, SVT, ZDF, SVT, RTBF, ARTV, NHK, CCTV9 …). Our notable productions include: Gabriel Le Bomin's "The Algerian War, the Fracture"; Caroline Fourest's "Marine Le Pen"; "Das Reich, Hitler's death squads" by Michael Prazan; "Middle Classes, a Life on the Wire" by Frédéric Brunnquell; "First Man"by Frédéric Fougea and Jérome Guiot; and "France between the two wars" by Romain Icard. "Simone Veil" by Hugues Nancy was selected at the Prix Europa and received France Télévisions's highest impact score for 2018. We are currently producing documentaries for Arte and France Télévisions on particularly complex subjects, often ones in echo with the news: "We, Muslims in France" by Romain Icard; "Globesity" by Sylvie Gilman and Thierry de Lestrade; "MBS, the Prince" by Antoine Vitkine; and Laurent Follea's "Frogies, What Will We Become?". We also explore "heritage" topics, mixing history and biographical portraits, such as "In the Shadow of Hitchcock" by Laurent Herbiet. Finally, we continue our daring exploration of ancient history with a 2×52' series on the French Revolution by Hugues Nancy and Jacques Malaterre for the prime time on France 2. After the sucess of "France between the two wars", we are developping the next episodes of our series on France during the 20th century.

She coproduced many series with BBC such as Walking with Dinosaurs and one- shots like D-Day. She initiated the renowned international trilogy on prehistory: L'Odyssée de l'Espèce, Homo Sapiens and The Rise of Man, on France3. In April 2011, she created her new production company, Nilaya Productions.

Business & Lifestyle Meet Kayla Santosuosso, Justin Brannan's New Deputy Chief Of Staff BY: Zainab Iqbal Kayla Santosuosso does not eat pizza with a fork. Want a slice to eat while walking? Go to Elegante. Want to sit and eat some pizza? Find a table at Lombardo's. Who was once a little girl sitting in her father's pizza restaurant in Ohio, is now an organizer and activist fighting for change in Bay Ridge. She's also Council Member Justin Brannan's new deputy chief of staff. Santosuosso (pronounced San-toh-soo-WOH-so) grew up in a small town in Ohio called Medina. During her childhood, it was mainly a farm town but has now converted into the suburbs. Santosuosso described it as a "mostly white, maybe socio-economically diverse, but not racially diverse at all, town in Northeastern, Ohio."

So I've been trying to keep my development skills somewhat sharp by working on coding up certain data structures in C#. Course I'd rather do this with F# or even some more interesting FP language (Elm anyone?) but I do have a need to be able to show this code to student developers and the students I get know C#. 1.) I found it hard to find an abstract discussion of these CRDT data structures. This article on Wikipedia is fine but there's some math notation there that I find a bit tough to read. I suppose I need to do a bit more digging. 2.) It's a bit of an impedance mismatch to try to build a read-only data structure in an imperative language. OO especially doesn't really seem to fit the idea of returning new data (as opposed to mutating in place) as well as it might. Still we soldier on as best we can. Without any further ado here's my code. I would greatly appreciate any comments that folks with a deeper knowledge of CRDT data structures may care to share.
Rudolf Steiner called his philosophy "Anthroposophy". 1. The exact the scientific method of research into the supersensible world founded by Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). 2. The results of this research. These are also known as "Spiritual Science" and are the necessary complement to Natural Science. They are the science of the supersensible constitution of man, of the spiritual beings in the nature and the cosmos, and they are also the extension of historical and other sciences, e.g., a scientific answer to the question: who was and is the Christ? 3. The application of the results gained through spiritual science in the practical life of the individual or of the community, for example, in education, medicine, curative education, pharmacy, agriculture, sociology, as well as the diverse branches of the arts. Otto Fränkel-Lundbourg. What is Anthroposophy? Trans: Joseph Wetzl. St. George Publications: Spring Valley NY, 1979. Page 9. Anthroposophy... cannot find its way through the world by ordinary agitation or propaganda, no matter how well meant. Agitation kills true Anthroposophy. Anthroposophy must come forward because the Spirit impels it to come forward. It must show forth its life because life cannot but reveal itself in existence. But it must never force its existence upon people. Waiting always for those to come who want it, it must be far removed from all constraint even the constraint of persuasion. Rudolf Steiner. The Life, Nature and Cultivation of Anthroposophy. Rudolf Steiner Press: London, 1963. Page 17. Above all one must know what the true standard and content of Anthroposophy should be. It does not consist of a sum of opinions which must be entertained by 'anthroposophists'. It ought never to be said amongst anthroposophists, 'We believe this', 'We reject that'. Such agreement may arise naturally as the result of out anthroposophical study, but it can never be put forward as an anthroposophical 'programme'. The right attitude can only be: 'Anthroposophy is there. It has been acquired by persistent effort. I am here to represent it, so that what has thus been acquired may be made known in the world.' It is still much too little felt in anthroposophical circles what a difference-indeed as between day and night exists between these two standards. Rudolf Steiner. The Life, Nature and Cultivation of Anthroposophy. Rudolf Steiner Press: London, 1963. Page 52.

Carol Channing, the wide-eyed, raspy-voiced Broadway star who made an indelible impression as Dolly Levi in "Hello, Dolly!" and as Lorelei Lee in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," died the morning of Jan. 15 at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 97. While studying drama and dance at Bennington College in Vermont, in 1941 she went to New York and auditioned for a role in Marc Blitzstein's musical play "No For an Answer." She got the role, and although the show closed after only three performances, her performance was praised, and she decided to pursue a Broadway career. She was cast as an understudy for Eve Arden in Cole Porter's "Let's Face It" and found work in nightclubs and at Catskills resorts, but returned home at her father's insistence in 1946. Convincing him to give her one more chance, she came to Los Angeles where she auditioned for Gower and Marge Champion, who cast her in their revue, "Lend an Ear." A success in Los Angeles, the show also played for a year on Broadway and led to her being cast in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" in 1949. Playing Lorelei Lee, the innocent flapper and gold digger, made her an immediate star. Time magazine wrote: "Perhaps once in a decade a nova explodes above the Great White Way with enough brilliance to re-illumine the whole gaudy legend of show business." The show ran for two years on Broadway, followed by a yearlong national tour; the song "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" became her signature song. She went on to star in "Wonderful Town," "Pygmalion" and "Show Girl" on Broadway, toured the country in her own cabaret act and performed in nightclubs with George Burns when Burns' wife and performing partner, Gracie Allen, was ill. The role of Dolly Levi in "Hello, Dolly!" brought her even bigger fame. A massive hit, it won 10 Tony Awards (including best actress for Channing), and ran for seven years. Channing left after the first year, but returned to the role on Broadway in 1977, 1981 and 1994. She also appeared as "Lorelei" (reprising her role from "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes") in 1973; "Sugar Babies" in 1980; "Jerry's Girls" in 1984; and with Mary Martin in "Legends!" in 1986. Channing's brassy, exaggerated persona didn't make an easy transition to film and TV. She received an Oscar nomination for supporting actress in 1967's "Thoroughly Modern Millie," but "The Carol Channing Show," a sitcom produced by Desilu productions in 1966, was never picked up. She guest-starred on many shows, including "Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In," Flip Wilson's show "Flip," "The Muppet Show," "Sesame Street" and "The Love Boat." She also played the White Queen in Irwin Allen's made for TV production of "Alice in Wonderland." A lifelong Democrat, her name appeared on Richard Nixon's "enemies list," which she called the highest honor of her career. Channing was married four times: to Theodore Naidish, Alex Carson, Charles Lowe and Harry Kullijian. She had one son, Channing Lowe, an editorial cartoonist, who survives her.
Climate change is, at its core, an energy problem, a problem of how we produce and use energy. The states have long recognised this and have led the clean energy revolution. The federal government has never set a comprehensive, coherent national energy policy. Yes, over the years, Congress has acted variously to support nuclear power and some renewable sectors, the exploitation of domestic fossil-fuel resources, and the opening up of the electric grid to independent power producers; but at the national level there has been no real attempt at comprehensive reform to drive energy production and use toward the lowest cost and least environmentally harmful resources. States have developed and implemented programmes for financing renewable technologies, until those technologies are able to compete on fair terms in the market. They have created new markets to provide not only electricity, but also the unique services – flexibility and balancing – that electricity production needs, because kilowatt-hours cannot yet be easily or economically stored. They have seen how technological change has made small-scale, distributed clean energy a reality, and made it possible for consumers to manage their demand in ways that benefit the system and save money. And they have implemented programmes that put a price on greenhouse gas emissions and create revenue streams for direct investment in clean energy measures, such as end-use efficiency and renewables, to accelerate emissions reduction and drive down the costs of compliance. The cumulative national carbon effects of state actions are already projected to achieve nearly all of what the CPP would require by 2030. Frederick Weston directs the Regulatory Assistance Project's China Program. He joined RAP in 1999 after eleven years as an economist and hearing officer with the Vermont Public Service Board, the state's utility regulator.
UConn: Offensive line coach Frank Giufre is being promoted to offensive coordinator, per multiple reports. Good for Frank! I've known the family for a very long time and Frank has tremendous coaching roots. Not an enviable position to be in though. The Boneyard base is in turmoil and most hate the internal promotion of someone who has, according to the board experts, "never called a play." I guess someone has to take the UCONN OC job but there have to be about 497,318 better coaching jobs in college football.

Casual Discussion Science Forum @scivillage › Culture › Fitness & Mental Health Scans Show Female Brains Remain Youthful As Male Brains Wind Down https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shot...-wind-down INTRO: Women tend to have more youthful brains than their male counterparts — at least when it comes to metabolism. While age reduces the metabolism of all brains, women retain a higher rate throughout the lifespan, researchers reported Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "Females had a younger brain age relative to males," says Dr. Manu Goyal, an assistant professor of radiology and neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. And that may mean women are better equipped to learn and be creative in later life, he says. The finding is "great news for many women," says Roberta Diaz Brinton, who wasn't connected with the study and directs the Center for Innovation in Brain Science at the University of Arizona Health Sciences. But she cautions that even though women's brain metabolism is higher overall, some women's brains experience a dramatic metabolic decline around menopause, leaving them vulnerable to Alzheimer's. [...] She thinks women's higher brain metabolism protects them from Alzheimer's when they are young. But menopause, she says, causes an "energy transition in the brain," one that affects the brain metabolism of some women far more than others. Brinton's research suggests that the women most likely to experience a dramatic drop are those who carry a gene variant called APOE4, which increases a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's, or those who have risk factors for Type 2 diabetes. "It's those women who will begin to develop the pathology of Alzheimer's disease earlier," she says.... MORE (details): https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shot...-wind-down Good.

4. One of the highlights or lowlights of practice was seeing fullback Tyler Clutts run in for a score against the first team defense to finish an easy drive in 11-on-11 drills. Now this was a first team offense that was without quarterback Tony Romo, who was on a rest day, receiver Dez Bryant, who is out with a hamstring, and the injured Randle. Coach Jason Garrett began a cursing tirade: "You blanking kidding me." Defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli also had choice words for the unit as did linebacker Sean Lee. 5. The defense did a lot better the next time around, holding the offense to a field goal. The increased intensity level on defense resulted in a brief skirmish after Clutts was stopped on a run. Defensive tackle Tyrone Crawford pushed Clutts. Offensvie tackle Tyron Smith quickly jumped in, pushing with Crawford. Defensive end Greg Hardy and center Travis Frederick were among the host of offensive and defensive players getting in on the action. 6. Rookie cornerback Byron Jones had a rough day. He was beaten by receiver Terrance Williams three times in the 1-on-1 drill. Jones also drew a flag for interference on a deep route to Williams during team drills. 7. Defensive tackle Tyrone Crawford is having a solid camp and holding his own against Pro Bowl guard Zack Martin. Crawford beat Martin in a 1-on-1 pass rush drill and then came back and beat Pro Bowl center Travis Frederick. The Cowboys expect big things from Crawford this year and he is showing why against two talented offensive linemen. 8. The pass rush compete drill in front of the team was won by the offense. Tackle Darrion Weems handled rookie defensive end Randy Gregory. Rookie guard La'el Collins won against rookie defensive end Ryan Russell. Defensive tackle Davin Coleman got a win for the defense against guard Mackenzy Bernadeau. The good news is that Weems, who is competing for the swing tackle spot, is starting to look better and better. He has worked with the starters for much of the last week in place of the injured Doug Free and will start at right tackle in the preseason opener against the San Diego Chargers. 9. Emerging receiver Cole Beasley is getting more and more put on his plate. Not only is he in the mix to be the primary punt returner as well as third receiver but he is now getting looks as the primary kickoff returner. 10. Rookie center Shane McDermott and third quarterback Dustin Vaughan had snap problems Monday that could pose a problem on Thursday. Both stand to get a lot of playing time in the preseason opener against the Chargers.
San Diego County Bar Association leader Janice Mulligan was recently appointed chair of the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Medical Professional Liability. She will assume her position as chair at the conclusion of the ABA Annual Meeting in Chicago, Aug. 4-9. It is a one-year appointment, subject to reappointment for a possible total of three years. The ABA's 15-member Standing Committee on Medical Professional Liability provides testimony to Congress and assists in the formulation of policy regarding medical professional liability at the national level. The committee opposes caps on pain and suffering awards and is in favor of trial by jury for health-related cases. Mulligan has served as a member of the committee since 1999. "ABA policy is very much in favor of consumers," Mulligan said. "It is a privilege to be able to advocate these positions at the national level." Mulligan, a partner in the law firm of Mulligan & Banham in San Diego, represents consumers in catastrophic cases arising out of medical negligence, pharmaceutical litigation, personal injury and elder abuse actions. She is an active member of the San Diego County Bar Association, having served on the bar board of directors between 1987-90, and chaired the bar's Lawyer Referral and Information Service community service effort between 1985-88. Mulligan currently serves on the Task Force on Judicial Appointments, a position she has held since 2001.
And it was free this time! The best way to let someone know you have quality products is give them one. All the plans on this site are of equal quality. This design is intended for experienced box builders only. ...You're probably wondering what the magic angles are, and all the dimensions etc. Okay, here they are: 8", 4", and 2". These are the three magic numbers needed to layout this design, regardless of the optional size you choose to make it. Wait a minute, optional size? Yes, you have the option of making the length any size between 24" and 36" ! The formula that determines the layout will automatically self adjust for any of the optional lengths you might choose for your horn. Cut two panels 36" wide by whatever depth you want between 24" and 36". Lay one flat on your bench. The illustrations are a top view of the panel laying on your bench. Take your tape measure and find the centers as shown. Draw these lines on your panel. From the bottom center measure 4" in each direction and make a mark as illustrated in blue. From the top right and left edges measure 8" and make a mark as shown. (only one side is marked in the illustration to keep it from getting cluttered.) Remember whatever you do on one half you must do to the other half. This is a mirrored design. Draw an X on the panel by connecting your marks as illustrated by the green lines. As you can see, you now have the lines to lay out 10 panels leaving only 4 to go! Starting at the top, draw a vertical line on each side of the panel 8" from the edge as illustrated in red. Now draw two lines connecting the three points illustrated by the circles. You now have the lines for two more panels, only two left now! Notice the intersection circled in orange. This point where two panels join should land on the original black X you drew when finding the centers. Following this point, like a road map, head North West on the black line and turn North (up) on the red line then back to the starting point on the green line. This triangle illustrates where to locate the stiffening strut on the panel, and shows the correct width to make it. Measuring 2" from the lower corner plot and intersection as shown. This point determines the throat of the horn. Since you're using material that is 3/4" of an inch thick, the throat opening will be 1.25 x 1.25 inches when measured from the inside after the panels are in place. NOTE: Enlarging this opening to no more than double, will raise the high frequency cutoff point. Combined with reversing the speaker baffle 180 degrees it is possible when using higher frequency drivers to reach a cutoff of 5khz. This is desirable when using this design as a full range enclosure. Applications of that would include PA use and Home theater Center Channels. The green circles illustrate the last two intersections needed to plot the line for the last panel illustrated by the green line. You now have the layout to build your horn. As you can see, the formula will self adjust for any height between 24" and 36". Pretty neat huh.. This allows you to have some control over the physical size of the cabinet for reasons of woofer selection, i.e.. internal chamber volume, and placement. A direct parallel between the efficiency curve and the height dimension is eminent. The larger up to the full 36 inches, will be louder. The way to cut your panels that make up the rest of this horn is simply to cut several 48 x 10" or 48 x 12" inch pieces to work with. The 10 or 12" dimension is used for 8 and 10" woofers respectively. Take one of these stock panels and lay it on the large panel you just drew a crop circle on. Using your pencil carefully align the panel with the lines you drew and trace the other side so that you create a duplicate set of line 3/4's of an inch away from the original set. This way you can see exactly how your panels will intersect, and where to locate them. Now take a protractor, and decide how you want to join your panels. You may wish to end join them or miter them. The determining factor will be the abilities of your table saw. I recommend drawing the joints on your masterpiece too. That way you wont forget how you're planning to join each panel. You'll be pleased to find out there is a way to join the panels (end join) so that almost every angle in the design can be cut from one setting on your table saw. In other words, most of the angles in this design are identical, no matter what size you picked for the height of the enclosure. If you think this is getting rather amazing, wait until you hear the sound quality of the perfectly flat, extended response of this horn and the incredible efficiency! The baffle for the speaker should be double thick, although it is only a suggestion. Once you have cut it and placed it as shown in the illustrations (Notice it follows the original center lines) you may flip it over 180 degrees if you want. Do what moves you as the best way. If you're going for a full range response, it must be flipped. Final construction tip... assemble the angled panels to the bottom that you drew on with wood glue, and then hot glue the seams. This will hold you box together during assembly, but before you do that, you might want to transfer the design to the top, so that you can drill holes in the top every 4 inches over every single panel in the box. We use a rubber gasket glued to the top edge of all the panels to achieve a seal against the top. The holes are for screws so that the top can be removed for service. That's it! One of the most complex but rewarding boxes you'll ever make.

At present, development of IWT mode is in a nascent stage and plays a very insignificant role in the overall transportation scenario of the country. However, the demand for IWT is expected to grow on a faster rate than ever before. The policy makers have recognised that there is a compelling need for revival of IWT system as a supplementary mode of transport in the integrated transportation system of the country. The significance of such development during the 9th Plan Five Year Plan has been emphasised. CIWTC has the expertise and experience to undertake IWT operations on a large scale. It is in a position to offer leadership in IWT development in the country. With adequate support from the Govt. of India, CIWTC can emerge as the principal IWT operator not only in Eastern / North-Eastern region but also other regions of the Country and can usher in an accelerated fast paced phase of development in this sector. Inland Water Transport on the rivers & some coastal routes was developed by the Britishers about 180 years ago. The Joint Steamer Companies i.e. India General Steam Navigation Co. and Rivers Steam Navigation Co. were made a P.S.U. in 1967 as CIWTC. The main activities are transportation of cargo in the rivers in the Eastern India & North-Eastern India and on the Indo-Bangladesh protocol routes. Operate & Maintain terminals.

Day 5 – Classes day. We woke up that morning and made the decision to skip out on first class and go mail stuff home while we still could. I shipped 40 pounds and it cost just shy of $80 – but worth every penny as flying home with that would have cost me more in overweight baggage fees. Stephanie shipped slightly less than I did – I think about 30 pounds and it cost her about $60? I texted home to tell DH about it, and he jokingly replied that the box might make it home before I do… this will eventually grow to be less funny in less than 24 hours… I digress… After shipping we took the first bit of leisure time for just us. We hit up a great little coffee shop I discovered the day before and did a coffee run to. Coffee in Utah seems to generally be awful – I am sure it is to appease the Mormons, but it doesn't appease the Starbucks lover in me. So, yummy mochas in hand on a gorgeous, hot sunny morning we took off to the top of the parking garage, sipped our coffees, took photos of the great scenery and just relaxed. For the first time all week we weren't on the go and could just breathe. So, back in to pick up our class kit from the first class. It was an acrylic mini-album from Little Yellow Bicycle and it was Hallowe'en themed. Their Hallowe'en papers are absolutely great! I really fell in love with their delicious Dolce Vita line on Thursday, but their Hallowe'en is stand out great as well. It was a well organized kit with lots of great instructions so I should be able to complete it at a crop no problem. Nice and easy. They also gave us a bonus tote bag and one extra sheet each of their Hallowe'en papers. Second class was from Piggy Tales. I don't necessarly *love* the paper used for this chipboard mini album, but I do love the chipboard mini album itself. It has a lot of fun sliding doors to hide things like journalling, or more photos, or patterned paper, or rub-ons – you get the idea. I did manage to get this one pretty much finished through class time and a bit over lunch. Third class was from Scenic Route and was taught by Layle Koncar. She was great, really great. Fun woman, loves to talk, and the layout turned out really nice. I mostly got that one done too, just need to stick some of the flowers down that were covered in glossy accents and not yet dry. Either way – cute layout, cute teacher and Scenic Route is for the most part pretty fun paper too. Stephanie won some cute little acrylic stamps in this workshop too. That night was commencement crop. For me it was just ok. The slideshow was very long, and the photos less inspiring than past years when Candace Stringham was taking them. She is one talented lady, and her replacement just didn't have the same eye that she does. I did, however, become a connoisseur of salt water taffy as it was everywhere on the tables – typical for the area. The crop carried on – we went out to hit the mall because I needed to buy some stuff from Bath and Body Works, and Stephanie needed to get back to Archivers to buy stamps that didn't get bought on a previous trip. On a neat aside, we happened to see CD Muckosky shopping at Archivers when we were there as well. She didn't seem to have anything to do with CKU – unless she was at the Scrapbooker of the Year banquet that we wound up missing because of the bus tour. When we got back to the crop, Lance Anderson from Rusty Pickle had set up a makeshift impromptu album workshop for $40. We went back to the room to finalize packing and get some semblance of sleep. So – we left off with the first woman I spoke with at United. She attempted to be pretty helpful, but was limited in what flights she was able to view. From what she could see there was no way we were getting home at all on Sunday, but she asked for a number I could be reached at if she should find anything. In the interim she gave me the number for United central reservations to call as they have access to a greater number of flights to view and can get a little more creative. I spent nearly an hour on the phone with him, and he managed to find a way out for us – leaving now at 6AM, by way of Los Angeles and then on to Toronto. It was another code share with Air Canada, which is what we originally booked on, however the issue was the first plane was United. He was able to confirm us on the United flight no problem, but couldn't reach anyone at Air Canada to confirm the second leg. I even sat on hold with Air Canada myself with no luck. With our flight now leaving at 6AM, it meant leaving the hotel at 3 to get to the airport for 4 and it was at this point pushing 2:30, with only one bellman on for the night. I asked this United guy if I could leave him a contact # so he could call me with confirmation numbers and he flat out refused to call me back. When I said to him "Clearly you've never been stranded before" it was met with silence, and then a persistent refusal to call me back. We get to Salt Lake Airport and are directed to some special line – Stephanie was taking care of this initial part while I returned the rental car. We wind up getting served by some disgruntled employee who was frustrated with United and hated working for them. He refused to charge us for our second bags, and didn't weigh them either – which was huge for Stephanie as her bags were definitely pushing the limit, if not over it. He also placed us in emergency exit row seating for the longest leg of the trip, which was also much appreciated. I don't really know much of the flights as it was the only sleep I was managing to grab in a 24 hour timespan. I slept the bulk of the way to LA, and from LA to Toronto I was awake for the small amount of time we were over Arizona, otherwise I was asleep. It was good to get home after more travel stress and ordeals. I didn't relish the idea of being stuck in Salt Lake for another night, especially with having to work on Monday – and now needing to pay for a lot of shopping. Customs was shockingly painless for both of us. We were both over and both claimed shipping items home that didn't accompany us. Neither of us had to pay, which was nice. The rumor mill has it that there will only be 2 CKU's next year – one east cost, the other west coast. There is also a rumor there will be another similar CK event in December that will be announced by Lisa B soonish. All the travel stresses were well worth it and I am filled with happy memories and lots of loot. The mecca was everything I hoped it would be and more. I really wish there was more time to go to some of the sales we missed, like Scenic Route, and DCWV and of course Cosmo Cricket and SEI. I can't wait until my huge box arrives. I shipped most of my purchases and freebies so I would have lots of room for the day 2 projects, that wound up being not so necessary after all. I know there are details I probably left out, but those days were just so jam packed and there was little sleep to be had – also so worth it! I can't wait for the next one!

New exhaust "straight through" - good sound! After the crash at the Crystal Palace Sprint at the end of May I placed Baggy Joe on hold until we had worked out the best way to restore him to the race track. My other project, "Chalky" a Fiat 126 from 1973 eligible for use in "Historic" AutoSolo events, was occupying the garage and since there was also a spare "Chalky 2" in the garage there was not much room for anything else. At one point neither car had any front wheels as we were putting 1987 parts onto the 1973 car (bigger wheels and brakes). When we found that they were not identical we decided also to change over the front of the cars as well. This involved cuttings off the front of the 1987 car in front of the front suspension and grafting it onto the body of the 1973 car. The measurements looked OK and we decided to "go for it". In my mind was the thought that was one option for Baggy Joe - remove the front from Baggy Jubillee and graft that onto Baggy Joe. Valuable experience would be gained before cutting off Baggy Joe's nose! Not wasted time then! These things are never as simple one might think and this was no exception. It all took much longer than expected and we did not start to put in serious time on Baggy Joe until the end of July. Well the Fiat experience convinced me that it was better to try to straighten out Baggy Joe than replace the damaged parts with better (?) parts from Jubillee! The photographs below show the twisted metal on Baggy Joe that would have to be pulled straight. See part 2, to follow. Back in business for fun! Part 2. The next pictures show the "straightening out process". Examination of the twisted and compressed panels suggested that they were all in front of the suspension and that the car still looked straight. Measurements from the front cross-member also looked good. The bent parts carried the radiator, fan, headlights and lifting system, the air duct, the bumper and the nose cone. None of these are structural and they should be possible to repair. With the rear competition tow ring tied to my 2 tonne Jeep Wrangler as an anchor, and the damaged parts attached to the pulling winch I use to load Baggy Joe onto the trailer, we started to pull - VERY SLOWLY - all the while keeping out of the way of wires and rope in case something broke! The right side was the worst and we decided to remove the vertical section on which the nose cone rests as this was already very rusty. Replacing that with the part from Baggy Jubillee seemed to be a good idea. To my great surprise and pleasure at the first attempt the right hand side radiator bracket started to unfurl just like a sail. It pulled downwards and well as forwards because the winch was on the floor. When the metal was 95% straight we changed over to the left side which was not as badly damaged. That also came straight quite quickly as we had realigned the winch to pull horizontally instead. More pictures attached. Part 3 Reassembly - the fun bit! I had ordered a new radiator as the original one was seen to be leaking as they pulled me out of the hedge! In fact the pipe taking the water from the heater into the radiator had broken off. That should be easily repairable for the future. In the mean time I wanted to improve the cooling, particularly when the car is sitting in the queue waiting for the start line. The engine has to be kept going as you move every 30 seconds but the heat build up in warm weather was quite a problem. Wearing full race overall flameproof racing suit ("Rompers" I call them!), fireproof helmet, FIA gloves and Nomex underwear plus the heater running full power and the windows and door open, I was close to expiring with the heat! More cooling was a VERY GOOD IDEA!. Guildford radiators made a new radiator within the limitations of the standard Bagheera end tanks. The core is now 42mm thick compared with 31mm on the standard product. There are also 25 rows instead of the 24 on the original. So we should have about 33% extra cooling capacity. In addition we realised that we could fit two Bagheera fans side by side with a little bit of modification! Photos below! You can also see that we have fitted the right side headlight from Baggy Jubilee. Instead of adding a second heavy cooler why not replace the rear window with a peace of perspex with some holes in it. Add some lightness as a famous English person once sad. Lowering the ambient engine temperature should lower the cooling needs. This is something I'm planning to do to my trackday murena. But keep up the good work, I'm sure you'll be back on the road in no time. btw, what is that bottle in the second picture of part 1? Well done! Will you make Etretat this year? My Rancho had the problem when driving in city traffic that the engine temperature was raising (too much for my liking). I had the standard core element in the radiator replaced with a "tropical core" which gives 30% better cooling. Add an additional high capacity fan, and the problem is solved. what is that bottle in the second picture of part 1? The brown plastic bottle is a Renault equivalent to the Matra/Simca/Renault 4 glass bottle. The cap is much easier to tighten and the relief valve seems to be more reliable. The downside is that the connection is on the bottom of the bottle and it has to be raised up by about 20mm on a block of wood. Recommended! PS To Sukkolk Pete. Yes, I am entered at Etretat at the end of August and do hope to be there. Baggy Joe's engine was run today for the first time since the accident. Apart from some minor leaks on hoses clamped with cheap non-"Jubillee" hose clips it looks good. I found some alternatives called "High Torque" which seem to be much stronger. Now for the rewiring and the GRP repairs! So, it's a coolant bottle, why isn't it at the back where the engine is? It's at the front where the radiator is! There is also more space there! I didn't respond to the idea of replacing the rear glass with lightweight plastic and making some air vent holes in it! Good idea! Graham Pryme has done the same thing on his Murena 2.2. I have not done it so far because I also entered Baggy Joe in AutoSolo events and you are not permitted to change window material in that class. Now I am building a Fiat 126 for "Historic" AutoSolo events there are a number of things I can do to improve performance and/or reduce the weight that were not permitted in AutoSolo, e.g. convert to perspex windows all round (execpt for the windscreen) - save the weight of the glass and remove the electric window motors etc. We made it to Etretat and completed the course! Baggy Joe is not "finished" as you can see in the pictures but he was good enough to compete! At scrutineering in front of the Mairie we put photos of the Crystal Palace crash on the windscreen and stickers on the repairs saying "Travaux en progres" (with the accents!). It caused a great deal of interest and we gained credibility. If we had said nothing they might have assumed that I thought it WAS finished and we would have lost credibility! As always everybody wins a prize at Etretat and the last picture shows me collecting mine! We were not last in that we beat several Fraser-Nash cars although I will admit my main objective was to get home in one piece and start to rebuild my confidence! Now, September 21st, I have three Sprints in the next five weeks and have a chance to win the Southern Area Sprint Championship in my Class. I already have won the Class Hillclimb Championship as nobody else can get enough points to beat me! There are not many in our class! I have started a new topic about Clutch problems. Any advice will be most welcome. I was in Etretat on the Sunday for reasons unconnected with the event, but it all seemed very low key. Apart from a couple of Austin sevens and Morgans and a road closure sign, there was no evidence of the "Cours de Cote". Anyway, well done!

"The Covered Market is dear to all our hearts, so to demonstrate Oxford Preservation Trust's support for it, and with the help of The William Delafield Trust, we are working in partnership with Oxford City Council to restore the Lindsey Butcher's units to their former glory." Debbie Dance, Director at Oxford Preservation Trust Oxford Preservation Trust received a generous grant from The William Delafield Charitable Trust to support the restoration of three stalls (Units 46-48) in Oxford's Covered Market, positioning the town's heritage at the heart of the city. This project sought to reclaim the original design of the high-quality retail units and showcase historic craftsmanship within the locally and nationally significant heritage asset that is Oxford's Covered Market. Uncovering the Past The Covered Market, in its original form, first opened in late 1774 and has remained in continuous use ever since. It was designed by architect, John Gwynn (who also designed Magdalen Bridge), as a replacement to the street markets. The sale of meat, fish and poultry on Oxford's streets was banned, with the passing of the 1771 Oxford Mileways Act signalling a gear change in the local history of transport, trade, and industry. The Mileways Act sought to encourage traffic into the city – a very different place to the Oxford we know today! The John Lindsey Butcher & Son unit is situated in the earliest surviving part of the Victorian market, designed by architect Thomas Wyatt the Younger, and built as part of the 'New Market' extension around 1839-40. The unit holds high evidential value with the potential to reveal information about the earlier form of the market and its various phases of change. Not only of architectural interest, Units 46-48 were also constructed using a variety of local professions and therefore sheds light on the fortunes of individual trades in Oxford. Hidden Treasure Revealed In May 2019, strip out works began in the unit, with the first element uncovered being the vaulted lath and plaster ceiling, which needed significant repair. When plasterboard was removed, wrought iron latticework was exposed, miraculously surviving in place between the units and wrapping around the outside, and originally the ventilation for the stalls. Although we initially believed the columns to be made of concrete, the removal of many layers of paint has revealed solid stone columns hidden beneath. Careful restoration is now taking place to mend the damage and restore their structural integrity. Taking off the latex floor screed has uncovered the original stone flag floor, well preserved in parts, and instantly adding character to the building, so that a decision has been made to repair, seal and to leave it exposed. We were pleased to launch Oxford Open Doors 2019 at the Covered Market with the theme 'Made in Oxford', and we opened the unit across the weekend for visitors to discover what we had found and to share our restoration plans. An Unexpected Year In January 2020, restoration work began on the unit, with lath and plaster repairs on the ceiling and repointing of original brickwork. However, by the end of March, the COVID-19 pandemic had taken hold, and lockdown brought the work to a halt. Nonetheless, by June progress was again being made with our dedicated and skilled contractors safely returning to the site. Keen to assist with the re-opening of the Covered Market to customers, a decision was made to remove the 1970s brick façade, which had been acting as the site hoardings, but was reducing the width of the aisle and space to move around within the market's public areas. On 15th June, the Market reopened with the original building line restored, enabling improvement to the sightlines of the avenues, and reintroducing the architectural rhythm of the market. The rear brick wall looks splendid with its limewash, and we were all thrilled with the craftsmanship that went into saving and restoring Lindsey's original painted signage above the door. More headway was made in August and September, with the plastering, painting, skirting, block paving and ventilation being completed, as well as the installation of the windows, doorframes, joinery, and reworked iron trelliswork. A carefully chosen colour scheme was also agreed to act as an exemplar for work to other units in the Market that might come forward in future years. The team visited the site to assess the scope of works to the incredible original stone floor, which has now been pointed. In 2021, the focus was on reaching project completion. This involved cleaning of the interiors, electrics, and final repairs to areas such as the fretwork. Lattice grilles have also been fabricated and fitted within the unit. The final touches also involved decorating the Units in a manner which was sympathetic with the original design- including the painstakingly detailed restoration of the old "Lindsey's" sign above the units. Excitingly, the units are now ready for new tenants to move into! Currently, the units are being leased to Makespace Oxford, who are collaborating with Oxford City Council to provide temporary 'meanwhile' leases to four Oxford-based retailers that have social and environmental purpose at their core. The four resident organisations are Ducky Zebra, a start-up creating colourful, sustainable clothing for children; Y.O.U Underwear, a social enterprise making a difference selling sustainable, organic undergarments with a focus on ethical supply chains; The Woolhound, an independent yarn and craft store; and Headington Fair Trade, a shop selling ethical and fairly-traded food, homewares, stationery and more.This arrangement will be running until February 2022, and will hopefully pave the way for a new era on Oxford's High Street, with the community at its heart. So please visit these businesses at the Covered Market before February and help support Oxfordshire-based Organisations! The Un-Covered Market In time for Oxford Open Doors 2021, OPT were delighted to share with our members the new Un-Covered Market Audio Tour created by the Covered Market and funded by Oxford City Council and the Museum of Oxford. The project brought together local historians, poets, filmmakers and artists to create "an immersive audio tour that's part informative and part poetic wandering. The 15 minute tour leads you around the market allowing you to stop and notice things you may have overlooked and giving you permission to discover new things about this well-known, well-loved building." The tour is free to stream/download, and all you need is a pair of headphones! Discover the history of the Covered Market for yourself HERE. As a communal, atmospheric, and trading hub, this Covered Market project has brought together multiple stakeholders. We are most grateful to Oxford City Council for their commitment to this project, working with James Mackintosh Architects, Cliveden Conservation, Croft Building and Conservation and Gelder Joinery. Once again, a huge thank you goes to the William Delafield Charitable Trust, without whom this project would not exist. Want to know more?

Asia > South Korea Pride organizers in South Korea urge police to protect their rights Richard Ammon | February 27, 2019 | South Korea | GlobalGayz Seoul's 20th Queer Culture Festival will kick off in May amid rising violence from conservative Christian groups Organizers of the largest LGBTI pride event in South Korea urged the government not to give in to conservative groups and protect attendees. The 20th Queer Culture Festival will take place in May, including a parade on June 1, organizers said at a press conference on Tuesday (26 February). Organizers have applied for government permission to use Seoul Plaza as the starting point of the parade. Pride events in Korea are increasingly under attack from conservative Christians. The groups pressure authorities to deny permission and violently disrupt activities. 'The government should drop its attitude of walking on eggshells around haters and instead show its willingness to guarantee universal rights for the socially marginalized, including sexual minorities' said organizer Kang Myung-jin. He called on the Seoul government and police to protect their rights to hold the event and ensure participants safety, according to the Korea Herald. Organizers tend to keep the pride parade secret until the last minute to deter anti-LGBTI activists. But, according to the Korea Herald, organizers made the date public early this year to confront the hatred head-on. Pride under attack South Korea's fledging LGBTI movement has triggered a conservative backlash, rights groups recently warned. Homosexuality is legal in South Korea. But, conservative attitudes, especially among Christians, force many LGBTI Koreans to live in the closet. What's more, there is currently no discrimination legislation to protect LGBTI Koreans. Same-sex marriage is also not legal. According to activist Minsoo Kim, LGBTI Koreans are 'facing hate and ignorance in every moment of their lives'. Conservative Christian groups have launched significant attacks against LGBTI pride events in 2018. More than 200,000 people signed a petition demanding the government acts to prevent the Seoul Queer Festival from taking place. 'We do not want to see their abominable events in a square' the petition read. Christian protesters, meanwhile, disrupted LGBTI events across the country. Anti-LGBTI protestors also blocked a pride festival in Incheon. In Busan,thousands of police protected pride attendees. This year's Seoul Queer Culture Festival takes the theme '20th Fight for Rights'. It is slated to include performances by bands, LGBTQ artists. There will be information booths from human rights organizations, global companies, embassies and universities to raise awareness of LGBTI issues. Organizers have also taken inspiration from Singapore and Hong Kong by including a 'pink dot'. Attendees will be encouraged to wear pink and gather together to show solidarity with LGBTI people. by Rik Glauert Source – Gay Star News Tags: south korea gay rights

HomeUncategorizedRoadside safety messages increase crashes by distracting drivers Roadside safety messages increase crashes by distracting drivers January 9, 2023 The Conversation Uncategorized Behavioural interventions involve gently suggesting that people reconsider or change specific undesirable behaviours. They are a low-cost, easy-to-implement and increasingly common tool used by policymakers to encourage socially desirable behaviours. Examples of behavioural interventions include telling people how their electricity usage compares to their neighbours or sending text messages reminding people to pay fines. Many of these interventions are expressly designed to "seize people's attention" at a time when they can take the desired action. Unfortunately, seizing people's attention can crowd out other, more important considerations, and cause even a simple intervention to backfire with costly individual and social consequences. One such behavioural intervention struck us as odd: Several U.S. states display year-to-date fatality statistics (number of deaths) on roadside dynamic message signs (DMSs). The hope is that these sobering messages will reduce traffic crashes, a leading cause of death of five- to 29-year-olds worldwide. Perhaps because of its low cost and ease of implementation, at least 28 U.S. states have displayed fatality statistics at least once since 2012. We estimate that approximately 90 million drivers have been exposed to such messages. Startling results As academic researchers with backgrounds in information disclosure and transportation policy, we teamed up to investigate and quantify the effects of these messages. What we found startled us. Contrary to policymakers' expectations (and ours), we found that displaying fatality messages increases the number of crashes. We studied the use of these fatality messages in Texas. The state provides a useful laboratory to study such messages, as it has 880 DMSs, 17 million drivers and, unfortunately, typically over 3,000 road-related fatalities per year. The most advantageous aspect of this sample, however, is that from August 2012 until the end of our sample in 2017, the Texas Department of Transportation only showed these fatality messages for one week each month — the week before the Texas Transportation Commission's monthly meeting. This institutional feature allowed us to compare, for instance, the hourly number of crashes occurring around a DMS during the week when fatality messages are being shown, relative to crashes on the same road segment during the other three weeks of the same month. Also, we were able to control for time of day, day of week, weather conditions and holidays. We found that there were two to three per cent more crashes within one to 10 kilometres downstream of each DMS during the week fatality messages were shown. This suggests that this specific behavioural intervention backfired in Texas. Warning distractions We conducted two tests to rule out whether this finding was simply because these weeks happen to be inherently more dangerous. First, we looked upstream of each DMS. In doing so, we limited our sample to those DMSs without another DMS within 10 kilometres upstream. We found no increase in accidents upstream of these DMSs, but still find an effect downstream. Second, we investigated whether the weeks before the monthly meetings of the Texas Transportation Commission had more crashes in the months before Texas began showing these fatality messages. Looking at data between January 2010 and July 2012, we found no evidence of a change in crashes during the week prior to the Texas Transportation Commission meeting. Based on our findings, we hypothesized that these fatality messages cause more crashes because they make drivers anxious and distract them. Our research found several pieces of evidence that supported this hypothesis. First, we found that the larger the displayed number of fatalities (a plausibly more shocking and distracting message), the greater the increase in crashes. Higher fatality counts are associated with significantly more crashes, whereas lower fatality counts are associated with fewer crashes. Related, fatality messages cause the largest increase in crashes in January, when the display shows the prior year's total in Texas. Conversely, there are marginally fewer crashes in February, when the fatality count resets and is at its lowest. Second, the increase in crashes is concentrated in more complex road segments, where focusing on the road is likely more important and the cost of a distraction more severe. We also found that crashes increased statewide during the weeks when messages were displayed, inconsistent with improved driving farther away from DMSs; that the days after a campaign end are no safer than other days; and that these messages continue to affect drivers after more than five years of showing fatality statistics. Counterproductive to safety Our research shows that displaying fatality messages does not result in safer driving and fewer crashes. Besides the more obvious takeaway that displaying fatality messages may be counterproductive, our findings highlight two broader issues. First, while behavioural interventions should grab attention, this can be taken too far and have costly consequences. Second, it is vital to evaluate policies and their outcomes over time, as even good intentions may not necessarily lead to the desired outcomes.

UAHDX Release! Finally, its here! The release of Ultra Air Hockey DX for PCs! Starting in October 2014, EagleSoft Ltd worked on its first Indie Unity3D video game, Ultra Air Hockey DX, not only for fun and for software engineering experience, but also as a university project for a Fundamentals of Software Engineering class programming project. This project was much more difficult than we first imagined, since we had to self-teach ourselves and to learn quickly a new programming language (C#), a game engine (Unity3D), and fundamentals of software engineering, including creating documentation such as an SRS, a Gantt chart, and a plethora of other documents. Nevertheless, through hard work and persistence, we finally finished programming the game in early January of 2015, and are ready to release it as a purchasable download from the shop section of the website! The game is currently available for Windows 7 (x86/x64), Mac OS X (x86/x64/universal), and Linux 10.04 (x86/x64/universal). A demo of the game for all of the previous OS and bit combinations is also available (the demo only has Air Hockey mode available) on the UAHDX Page and at the shop (for free). Everything is finished with the game (all powerups, all 3 modes, and all game assets), except for online multiplayer. We plan on implementing this complex feature, as well as any other bug fixes, post-mortem as a update patch. Below is an advertisement for the game, showing off all of the gameplay features. We hope you enjoy the game as much as we had in creating it! EagleSoft Ltd and UAHDX Dev Team Please login with either OpenID or a Google Account, and then post your comment. Please be respectful and courteous. NO SPAM ALLOWED! UAHDX v1.1 and Android ports in progress! New website domain! EagleSoft Store Deployed!
27 June 2019 / SF News / Joe Kukura Solano County Teens Accused Of Online Dating Scam Where Victims Were Shot, Robbed You've heard of online dates going badly, but this scheme entrapped two separate victims who were shot, robbed, and left abandoned in rural Solano County. A couple of 18-year-old men in northern Solano County may be a little apprehensive to get back into the online dating game, as we have news today of scam "dates" that left both shot and robbed — and in one case, also relieved of two ounces of his marijuana. The Sacramento Bee reports that three Woodland teens have been arrested for luring two male victims to setup dates, shooting and robbing them, and leaving both abandoned and bleeding on Putah Creek Road in unincorporated Solano County. ***PRESS RELEASE*** 2 Arrested on 2 Cases of Attempted Murder & Armed Robbery On April 22, 2019 just after midnight, a... Posted by Solano County Sheriff's Office on Monday, June 24, 2019 The Solano County Sheriff's Office details the scheme pretty thoroughly in the above Facebook post; two separate incidents happened in April and June, with the suspects using the same M.O. According to the sheriff's department, 18-year-old Amit Chhoker connected with the victims using an online dating service, picked them up in a green Land Rover, and drove them out to a remote road. "Then they'd get intimate," Solano County Undersheriff Brad Dewall told KPIX. Except things would take an ugly turn. Suspected accomplices Branden Lerma, 19, and a 17-year-old suspect whose name has not been released, allegedly ambushed the car from nearby bushes and pulled each victim from the vehicle. The suspects allegedly told the victims to curl up in a ball on the ground, at which point they were promptly shot, and in both cases the victim was robbed of his phone, cash, and shoes. "He walked about a mile for help," Dewall says of one of the victims to the Woodland Daily Democrat. Stealing the victims' phones may not have been the best move, though, as law enforcement was able to ping one of the phones and track down its location. The three have been arrested and charged with armed robbery and attempted murder. Each of the three is claiming that another one pulled the trigger, though Solano County sheriffs say "Lerma is believed to be the shooter in at least one of the incidents."

RS Components' support for Young Enterprise expanded after two decades of involvement 22nd March 2019 News 491 Views RS Components (RS) has expanded its support for the 2019 Young Enterprise initiative. RS, which has been involved with the programme for almost 20 years, hosted a week-long workshop at both its Corby head offices and the RS Local branch in Watford. These workshops provided a great opportunity to inspire local talented students to develop their design and engineering skills. RS invited students to its offices in Corby from local schools including Northampton High School, Gartree High School, Kingsthorpe College, Northampton School for Boys, Northampton School for Girls, Rawlins Academy and The Duston School and gave them a challenge to repurpose everyday disposable items. Following this, the students will now work on their design projects for one month before sending them to the RS judging panel which includes Lindsley Ruth, Chief Executive of Electrocomponents. Up to ten finalists will be invited to the Group head office in London in June to present their projects back to the panel. Earlier this month RS helped to curate the Young Enterprise presentation delivered to 130 gifted and talented Year 9 students from across the UK. The programme helps students build skills including marketing, finance and communications to aid employability. RS also provided STEM ambassadors as mentors for the students, available to them on each day of the week-long event. Laura Giddings, STEM education manager, Northern Europe, commented: "RS has been working with the Young Enterprise programme for almost two decades, and we have extended our support this year to demonstrate our passion for inspiring young entrepreneurs, and our commitment to promote engineering. Young Enterprise's mission statement is 'to inspire and equip young people to learn and succeed through enterprise' – an ambition which is close to our own, which is to enable and inspire tomorrow's engineers to make more possible. "Over the week, we have delivered valuable information about engineering and technology to the students and shown them how RS supports engineers and technologists. The students really enjoyed their time with RS, taking on board the knowledge and advice that was offered to them. We can't wait to see how the efforts from this week will translate into designed products." Robin Neighbour, area manager for Young Enterprise in Northamptonshire, said: "We're grateful for the support RS has given to Young Enterprise over the years. This year has been phenomenal with support on the presentation to students – which is a key part of inspiring them to participate in the initiative – and support with hosting and judging. We're thrilled with the calibre of students coming through the programme and it's been great to focus on the important area of technology and engineering." The deadline for entries is 26th April, with finalists announced on Friday 10th May.

Q: Is it OK to create 2 instances of C# MongoClient connecting to the same replica set? I used to create an instance of MongoClient from the official driver and register it in the DI as a singleton. But now because of design issues, I have to create another MongoClient instance in the other place to connect to the very same Replica Set. Are there any potential problems? Do the two instances will use the same connection or create two separate connections? Project is written in ASP.NET Core 3.1 MongoDB driver's version 2.8 MongoDB server uses 4.2 A: Currently, if all client options are the same, it will work since the underlying mongo client's data is stored on the cluster level. And as it was mentioned in the comments above, mongoClient constructor tries to retrieve this data from the static storage each time when you create a new client. However, there is a restriction, your MongoClientSettings should not contain the configured ClusterConfigurator option. Otherwise, it will lead to creating two different clusters with all related stuff for example connection pools. Also, see Re-use section here: https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.10/reference/driver/connecting/
Scientists at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center say they have developed a technique for finding where DNA repair happens throughout all of human DNA. Their study ("Genome-wide analysis of human global and transcription-coupled excision repair of UV damage at single-nucleotide resolution"), published in Genes & Development, offers scientists a potential way to find and target the proteins cancer cells use to circumnavigate therapy, according to the researchers, who add that the benefit of this new method could be more effective and better tolerated classes of cancer therapeutics. The research, led by Aziz Sancar, M.D., Ph.D., the Sarah Graham Kenan professor of biochemistry and biophysics, reportedly marks the first time scientists have been able to map the repair of DNA damage over the entire human genome. When DNA is damaged, cells use many enzymes to cut the strand of DNA and excise the damaged fragment. Then, other enzymes repair the original DNA so that the cells can function properly. Previously, Dr. Sancar's lab relied on purified enzymes to discover how this process happens in DNA damaged by UV irradiation and by chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin and oxaliplatin. In recent years, Michael Kemp, Ph.D., a researcher on Dr. Sancar's team, found that a particular protein called TFIIH bound tightly to the excised damaged DNA fragment in the test tube. But for this information to be truly useful to biomedical researchers, the experiment needed to be replicated in human cells. Extracting a stable TFIIH-DNA fragment proved difficult. Not until postdoctoral fellow Jinchuan Hu, Ph.D., joined Dr. Sancar's lab could the team accomplish the task. Through a series of sophisticated experiments with human skin cells, Dr. Hu exposed the cells to UV radiation and used an antibody against the enzyme TFIIH to isolate the enzyme complex with the excised DNA damage. Then he created experimental techniques to pull the enzyme, as well as the excised DNA fragment it was bound to, from the cells. The fragment was stable enough for Dr. Sancar's lab to sequence it. Then, Sheera Adar, Ph.D., fellow postdoc, and Jason Lieb, Ph.D., co-senior investigator of the study used their expertise in computational biology to analyze where the DNA repair happened throughout the entire genome and thus generate a human genome repair map for the first time. Because UV radiation and common chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin cause DNA damage in similar ways, Dr. Sancar's team is now using their new DNA excision repair method, known as XR-Seq, to study cells affected by cisplatin. They also hope to use it to study the biochemical reactions in animal models with the goal of finding the specific mechanisms that allow cancer cells to repair DNA damage to survive. "XR-seq and the resulting repair maps will facilitate studies of the effects of genomic location, chromatin context, transcription, and replication on DNA repair in human cells," wrote the investigators. The research also revealed that parts of the genome scientists previously thought did very little are actually part of this repair process. On chromosomes, DNA forms genes that create proteins. Between these genes, there are DNA sequences.
I went out adulting today. I bought myself a new lamp for my bedroom and some seriously bright light bulbs. The story starts about a year ago, when the kids finally convinced me that we needed to move out of the construction zone that was our former apartment. We toured a bunch of apartment communities -- and when I say "a bunch," I mean nine or ten. The list of potential apartments took some serious research and planning, nearly all of it done by Amy. What made it tougher than your typical apartment search was that we were looking for a three-bedroom place -- or at least a two-bedroom with a den -- so each of us could have a real door we could shut. (In the old place, we'd used Japanese screens to make a bedroom for Kitty out of the dining room.) A second bathroom was also on our wish list, as well as access to public transit and a short commute. After all that work, after touring all those properties and looking at our preferences...we had zero properties that all three of us liked. We reconsidered our criteria and decided to go back to a couple of places that could work if we worked at it. One of them was this place, which was awesome in nearly every way -- except that the den, which someone would have to sleep in, was an interior room with no window. (Which is why they couldn't call it a bedroom, I suspect. Bedrooms have to have two means of ingress and egress in case of fire.) Other than that, it was a great apartment. I mean, the location is stellar and the kitchen is to die for. So guess who fell on her sword and said she'd take the den? I didn't think having no natural light in a bedroom would bug me as much as it does. But I recently realized I've been doing a lot of knitting -- way more than I've been writing. And it's partly because the knitting chair is by the big window in the living room, and my desk is in my bedroom. Once I figured that out, I realized Something Needed to Be Done. The extra lamp made a difference, but the real key was the type of lightbulb I put in it. I picked up a pack of GE's Refresh LED bulbs, which are billed as providing energetic daylight. "Recommended for home offices," the package said. I expect I would be less thrilled with this "energetic daylight" thing in the lamp next to my bed. But at least now I'm looking forward to sitting at my computer. Who knows? Maybe I'll even get some writing done. I'll bore y'all with a knitting post next week. Oh, one piece of housekeeping: Google Plus is being dismantled, and one of the first casualties is the G+ comment plug-in on blogs like mine. So hearth/myth is back to the native Blogger comment system, which has never worked particularly well. Apologies for that. These moments of well-lit blogginess have been brought to you, as a public service, by Lynne Cantwell. Every Presidents' Day weekend, my daughters attend Katsucon, a massive anime convention across the Potomac River from us in National Harbor, Maryland. (When I say massive, I mean massive. They have 21,000 attendees this year.) Kitty is the assistant head of Video Operations, so my kids get there a day earlier and stay a day longer than the regular attendees. Which means I've had the apartment to myself since I got home from work Thursday -- or (checks the time) approximately 76 hours. And counting. Yesterday, Kitty texted me to ask whether I could run something over to her in a few hours, after she got some sleep. Sure, I said. Then she offered to send me a reminder text. "I think I'll be okay. There's not much here today to distract me," I said. She LOL'ed and offered to text me earlier, "if you wanna cut the boredom sooner." But it's not the same diff. At work, I sit in a doorless cubicle in a hallway. My phone has twelve active lines. There's always background noise -- conversations, phones ringing. Then to get to work, I take public transit, and there's always background noise there, as well -- announcements over the intercom, other commuters' conversations, trains and buses starting and stopping. It's distracting. And at home, our schedules are different enough that someone is always coming or going, or listening to music, or sleeping, or having a conversation. It gets to the point where it's hard to find a minute to think. These moments of laid-back blogginess have been brought to you, as a public service, by Lynne Cantwell. I hear there's some kind of sportsball thing happening tonight. Which means some of y'all will soon be really happy, some will be angry and/or sad, and some will be too stuffed from the buffet to care. Then there's the contingent who suffer through the game just to watch the halftime show. From what I'm seeing in my Facebook feed, those folks are already regretting their life choices tonight. Well, fear not! I have here a thing that everyone can win. Do you guys like word searches? I loved them as a kid. I was already good at spelling, and it turned out I was also good at spotting letter combinations in word search puzzles. You wouldn't think that would be a useful life skill -- but then I became an editor. Anyway, below you will find a word search puzzle. The word list consists of the names of some of the deities in the Pipe Woman Chronicles universe, as lifted from the table of contents of A Billion Gods and Goddesses, 2nd Ed. I used an online word search generator for this puzzle, and I haven't tried it myself yet. The words can go in any direction -- up, down, across, forward and backward, and diagonally. The generator wouldn't take a word that was more than 15 characters, so White Buffalo Calf Pipe Woman has been shortened to "goddess," which is what Naomi calls her most of the time anyway. Also, the graphic is a .png converted from a pdf. I hope it's clear enough. If not, Adobe owes me fifteen bucks.

After one wound up lodged in the airway of a five-year-old boy. Angela Henderson shared the post on the Finlee and Me Facebook page, reminding parents to "cut the damn grapes" after one wound up lodged in the airway of a five-year-old boy. "Attention Parents," the post begins. The grape became lodged in the boy's airway last week and his mother gave Angela permission to share their story. "This sweet soul had to be operated on, under general anaesthetic to remove the grape" the post continues. "He is VERY lucky that part of his airway was open or else this could have ended badly. Since posting, the X-ray has been shared over 25,000 times with many people warning their friends. "As a former paramedic - grapes and hot dogs are the worst for lodging in throats, but anything soft and circular can be deadly. I always encourage anyone I see feeding young kids soft, circular items, to cut the food in half."
Bo's daughter succumbed to a rare liver disease in 2003, three years after she graduated from Marquette. So he and his wife, Candy, started the Nicole Ellis Foundation, which is funded mainly through private gifts and the annual Warrior Golf Outing. The foundation also provides an annual scholarship through Marquette's Ethnic Alumni Association and supports the American Liver Foundation. Kevin is an institution. As senior vice president of public and community relations for the Baltimore Ravens, an organization he has been with for 31 years, he oversees an award-winning staff responsible for the team's website and most of the print publications. He also has provided media relations assistance at 24 Super Bowls and two Pro Bowls and was Marquette's sports information director during the final years of Al McGuire's tenure. As a season ticket holder for Marquette men's and women's basketball, Craig and his wife, Wendy, don't miss a game. And as a major supporter of Marquette athletics, Craig doesn't miss an opportunity to help the university's student-athletes and proud athletic tradition continue to soar to greater heights. Playing basketball at Marquette was just the beginning of Tom's athletic connection to the university. He served four terms as M Club president, the longest in history; was a member of the men's basketball alumni reunion committees; is on the Marquette Athletics Board; and, with wife Pat, has committed to establishing endowed scholarships for men's and women's basketball through their estate plans.
The Wood Word • February 24, 2019 • https://www.thewoodword.org/top-stories/2019/02/24/opinion-the-year-without-an-oscars-host/ OPINION: The year without an Oscars host Photo credit to the American Broadcasting Company. Ashlynn Gallagher, Opinion Editor At this year's Oscars, the bold decision has been made to go without a host. It's no secret the Academy originally planned on Kevin Hart hosting before his controversial drop out. While it is unclear whether or not the Academy asked other celebrities to host it is clear what their answer was. One of my favorite parts about award shows are the hosts' opening monologues. Call me crazy, but there is something satisfying about watching celebrities make fun of each other for over five minutes. Getting to see Jimmy Kimmel mock Matt Damon and Mel Gibson brings me more joy than I'm proud to admit. If I'm going to sit down and stare at my television screen for hours on end, I want to be entertained. I want to laugh and cry. I want to feel something. With a lack of human interaction, I just don't see how that's possible. Having celebrity presenters like Michael B. Jordan, Constance Wu and James McAvoy helps, but the presenters are not as memorable as the host. Over the years, stars like Bob Hope, Billy Crystal and Steve Martin graced the stage, setting the bar high for all future hosts. The host is the life of the party. They are the comedic break we all need while watching endless categories and acceptance speeches. Who could forget when Jimmy Kimmel brought a group of tourists into the theater mid-ceremony to get autographs, Hugh Jackman's memorable opening number honoring that year's nominated films or when Ellen DeGeneres had pizza delivered to hungry guests while staging the most iconic selfie of all time? The last time the Oscars didn't have a host was in 1989 which featured an infamous 11-minute musical opening featuring Rob Lowe and Snow White. Let's just hope they learned from their previous mistake because after having record-low views last year, they can't afford another poor ceremony. I'm not saying that the show can't end well. Who knows, this could be one of the best shows they've had in years, but to say I am skeptical would be an understatement. When it comes down to it, every great ceremony needs a great emcee. Don't worry Academy, there's always next year… have your people call my people. Contact the writer: [email protected] Twitter: @AGallagherTWW
Retired Gary Neville backed to replace Gray at Sky Gary Neville is now as short as 3/1 to replace Andy Gray at Sky following his retirement from football. The 35-year-old Manchester United full-back has ended his competitive career and a move into the media could well be on the cards, with Victor Chandler cutting the odds on the former England man becoming a Sky Sports pundit to 3/1. There is a vacancy to fill following Gray's recent departure from Sky following allegations of sexist behaviour and Neville's retirement could come at the perfect time for him to fill the position. Jamie Redknapp is currently the 8/11 favourite. Neville, who made 602 appearances for United and 85 for England, said of his retirement: "I have been a Manchester United fan all my life and fulfilled every dream I've ever had. I am disappointed that my playing days are at an end. However, it comes to us all and it's knowing when that time is and for me that time is now."

Q: find all permutations of non-overlapping polygons in R (sp or sf objects) I have a spatial object (say a Multipolygon in sf or a SpatialPolygons in sp) and I want to find all the possible permutations of non-overlapping features. Here are some diagrams that illustrate what I am after. Let's say I have the following polygons. library(sf) # points a <- st_as_sf(data.frame(lon = c(1,2,3.5,3,6), lat = c(0,1,0,1.5,-3)), coords = c('lon', 'lat')) # circles b <- st_buffer(a, 1) # colors cols = c('grey', 'red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue') cols = adjustcolor(cols, alpha.f = .5) # plot plot(b, col = cols) I am after a routine that would create the following 3 objects whose plots would look like: a. b. c. Ideally, the routine would also allow for a threshold on the intersection of polygons. I think whatever routine I could write myself would take prohibitively long even for moderate-sized objects (say, 150 polygons, yielding lots of possible combinations). I was hoping that someone have already figured this problem out. A: M <- st_overlaps(b, sparse = FALSE) * 1 (M <- 1 - M) # [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] # [1,] 1 0 1 1 1 # [2,] 0 1 0 0 1 # [3,] 1 0 1 0 1 # [4,] 1 0 0 1 1 # [5,] 1 1 1 1 1 colnames(M) <- c('grey', 'red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue') library(igraph) A <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(M) max_cliques(A) # [[1]] # + 2/5 vertices, named, from dae1f9f: # [1] red blue # # [[2]] # + 3/5 vertices, named, from dae1f9f: # [1] grey blue yellow # # [[3]] # + 3/5 vertices, named, from dae1f9f: # [1] grey blue green cliques(A) # ... # Omitted, 13 cliques in total First we use st_overlaps to get a kind of adjacency matrix, M, where two polygons are adjacent in this graph if they overlap in your data. But actually we are going to need 1 - M, where two polygons are adjacent in this new graph if they don't overlap. That's useful because what you are looking for then corresponds to (maximal) cliques in this graph: cliques find all complete subgraphs in the input graph, obeying the size limitations given in the min and max arguments. max_cliques finds all maximal cliques in the input graph. A clique in maximal if it cannot be extended to a larger clique. The largest cliques are always maximal, but a maximal clique is not neccessarily the largest. In this case cliques are sets of polygons where none of the polygons overlap with any of the rest. Also, as to apply this to sp objects, you only need to compute a corresponding M. I believe that over helps with that. Bonus As to add the possibility for thresholds, we just need to recompute M. aux <- function(x) if (length(x) == 1) x else 0 M <- matrix(1, nrow(a), nrow(a)) for(i in 1:nrow(a)) for(j in 1:nrow(a)) M[i, j] <- aux(st_area(st_intersection(b[i, 1], b[j, 1]))) diag(M) <- 0 Then, for instance, if we count two polygons as intersecting only if the intersection area is greater than 0.2, we run M <- 1 * (M > 0.2) # Getting threshold-overlaps M <- 1 - M # The needed adjacency matrix

The harvest of the top-quality kiwi for the Sweeki brand has started in Chile. Origine Group plans to sell 2,000 tons of Italian kiwifruit, and intends to sell the same amount from Chile as well. In Chile, the harvest of green kiwis for Origine Group's "Sweeki" brand has begun. This season, the two Chilean members of Origine Group, David del Curto and Copefrut, will increase the quantity of Hayward kiwi under the brand "Sweeki Green", used to market top-quality Origine Group kiwis. Only kiwifruit of a superior quality, excellent appearance, high sugar content, and high dry matter can become a Sweeki kiwi. In the orchards of the two Chilean companies, the picking started with high hopes, in terms of both quantity and quality. Chilean-grown Sweeki kiwi will be mostly directed to the Asian market, where they will join the late Italian kiwi, of which shipments are drawing to a close. Alessandro Zampagna, Managing Director of Origine Group. The very first shipments of Sweeki from Chile are expected shortly in the coming weeks. The consortium Origine Group was founded in 2015 by several companies who are leaders in international markets in the production and trading of fresh fruit and vegetables. The consortium – established by Afe, Apofruit, Fruit C2, Gran Frutta Zani, Kiwi Uno, Op Kiwi Sole, Pempa-Corer, Salvi-Unacoa, Spreafico, Minguzzi and the Chilean groups David Del Curto and Copefrut – represents companies already firmly present in domestic and international markets, with a total turnover of over 1,200 million dollars. They have joined forces to provide top-quality products and are working together on innovative new varieties to explore new and emerging markets.

The bill's sponsor and families dependent on THC oil were scrambling to get it to a vote ahead of Crossover Day. AJC Deja News: Georgia governor roots out marijuana crops (1984) Mandi Albright, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution A review of the news that made The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's front pages through the decades. Today's AJC Deja News comes to you from the Thursday, March 22, 1984, edition of The Atlanta Constitution. HARRIS PLANS TO STOP POT AT SOURCE: TEAMS TO SEEK OUT MARIJUANA FIELDS Georgia Governor Joe Frank Harris declared all-out war in 1984. On pot. He even had a cool name for his battalion: The Governor's Special Strike Force on Drug Suppression. Its logo? "A bright green marijuana leaf with a helicopter superimposed on it, the propeller tearing through the plant," Constitution reporter Celia W. Dugger wrote in her article detailing the state's plan to root out pot in the Peach State. Gov. Joe Frank Harris began an aggressive war on illegal marijuana growing in Georgia back in 1984. Photo: AJC Newspaper Archives "More than 200 state employees this spring will be swooping over Georgia in helicopters and planes," Dugger continued, "hiking into remote wooded areas, and harvesting for destruction one of the state's most lucrative cash crops -- marijuana." The governor had just empowered the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to "enlist and organize the resources of other state departments to combat marijuana growing." Now, fast-forward 35 years. Georgia legislators are considering bills this session to allow medical marijuana to be grown in the state and sold to patients. Photo: Mike Snook / Special to AJC The Georgia Hemp Farm Act, HB 213, would provide for licensing and permit requirements for hemp growers and hemp processors. HB 324 would permit medical marijuana growing, manufacturing, testing and distribution at 60 dispensaries. » Live: Use the AJC's tracker to follow Georgia bills The AJC's Mark Niesse writes in a March 5 article that the "dispensaries would serve the state's rising number of physician-approved medical marijuana patients — more than 8,400 so far. Marijuana would remain illegal for recreational use." Growing legal cannabis wouldn't be cheap. "Initial licenses would cost $150,000 for large companies, $37,500 for smaller companies and $30,000 for retailers," Niesse writes. "Businesses would also have to pay annual license renewal fees ranging from $10,000 to $50,000." A member of the Drug Suppression unit of the Governor's Task Force removes marijuana plants found near Southlake Mall in Morrow, Georgia, June 9, 1988. Photo: BILLY DOWNS / AJC File In our March 1984 report, GBI Director Phil Peters told the Constitution that in 1983, "state and local officials uprooted more than 660,000 marijuana plants with a street value of more than $291 million, and arrested 140 people in connection with the seizures." Attitudes towards marijuana and laws regulating it have relaxed in the U.S. since the '80s. Washington D.C. and 10 states -- Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington -- have all legalized recreational marijuana use. Georgia's medical marijuana law, passed in 2015, allows patients to possess and use marijuana with less than 5 percent THC, but it remains illegal to buy, sell or transport it. THC is the main psychoactive component of the cannabis plant. When the AJC asked Georgians in January 2018 if marijuana should be legalized for any use, 50% of respondents said yes, 46% said no and 3% said they didn't know. According to an October 2018 Gallup poll, 66% of Americans support legalizing pot. Georgia lawmakers on the House Study Committee on Industrial Hemp Production voted unanimously Dec. 3 to support the start of in-state hemp farming. The proposal will be considered by the Georgia General Assembly next year. From left: state Reps.

MARK NIESSE / MARK.NIESSE@AJC.COM As for Governor Harris' anti-drug team, it's still operating -- just under a different name: the Governor's Task Force on Drug Suppression. Gone is the old "Strike Force" designation. Additionally, the Georgia Department of Public Safety now oversees the state's eradication/suppression program instead of the GBI. While societal norms and marijuana laws have changed in the past 35 years, the GTF's methods for finding and confiscating illegal marijuana crops is much the same as it was in the mid-'80s. Trained pilots look for pot plants from the air while folks on the ground seek it out and yank it up by the roots. "We're going to do it the old-fashioned way," GBI Director Peters told the AJC in 1984. "By hand." Staff writer Mark Niesse contributed to this article.

Bar do Peixe feels like it is a million miles away and as a result the bar has become a zen-like escape for those looking to leave the city. On a pristine stretch of Portuguese coastline – only a short trip from Lisbon – you'll find the village of Aldeia do Meco, which has become legendary for its especially smooth sweep of golden sand, rocky cliffs, and bohemian vibes. Set directly on the beach among this fantastic natural scenery is Bar do Peixe, home to a dedicated crowd of locals and visitors alike who appreciate great drinks, good music, tantalizing fresh seafood, and sweet sunset views. While only around forty kilometers from the capital Lisbon, Bar do Peixe feels like it is a million miles away and as a result the bar has become a zen-like escape for those looking to leave the city. This doesn't mean that it isn't a lively place though, as sunset parties here are often talked about all the next day. Especially in the summer, elite DJs spin, whipping a beautiful crowd sipping sundowners of white sangria and port & tonic into a frenzy. The festivities don't end in autumn, though, as this stretch of coast is sunny and bright year-round and Bar do Peixe has been known to make a fantastic mulled wine in winter. Even though the bar has become famous all over Europe for its cocktails and nightlife, the grilled seafood here is hands down some of the best on the coast, confirming Bar do Peixe status as a true triple threat.

Subscribe to the Magazine & Save Meghan Markle's Wimbledon Outfit Was a Special Nod to Her First Date With Prince Harry By Melanie Aman July 16, 2018 meghan markle, The headlines at Wimbledon this year were all about Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle's first ever public friends date, so we don't blame you for missing the tribute Meghan wore to her husband, Prince Harry. What was so special about her Ralph Lauren striped button-up and flared white pants? It was actually a subtle nod to how she and her husband first met. Meghan Markle attended Wimbledon back in 2016 as a guest of the fashion designer Ralph Lauren. At some point, she became friends with Violet von Westenholz, who works for the brand's PR department. It just so happens that von Westenholz is a childhood friend of Prince Harry — and she reportedly set up her two friends on a blind date. (Photo Credit: Getty Images) "Harry was having a really hard time finding anyone," a source told E! at the time. "It was something he had confided in his closest friends about; he was ready to meet someone but it was so hard to actually find the right person." Neither Meghan nor Harry have named the identity of their matchmaker, but one thing's for sure: Whoever set them up obviously got it right. Meghan did confirm that before the date she had no idea she was meeting Prince Harry. "It was definitely a set-up. It was a blind date," she said in the couple's first interview after announcing their engagement. "I didn't know much about him and so the only thing I had asked her when she said she wanted to set us up was, I had one question, I said 'Was he nice?'" Of course, Prince Harry proved himself to be more than just nice and roughly two years later he and his beloved tied the knot.

He is best know for portraying the young magician Harry Potter. Daniel was cast for the role at age 11 and starred in the series for 10 years until the release of the final movie in 2011. Radcliffe poses at a photocall for 'Kill Your Darlings' during the 70th annual Venice International Film Festival, Venice, Italy, September 2013 Daniel is the only child of a literary agent and a casting agent, who had both acted as children. He first expressed a desire to act at the age of five and at the age of 10, he made his acting debut in an adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield, portraying the title character as a young boy. The huge success of Harry Potter series brought him so much fame and so busy schedule at such a delicate age, that it wasn't easy for him to keep going to school, so he continued his education through on-set tutors.

Baltimore Police Department in 'Chaos' over Old, Unsupported Technology Charlie Nash The Baltimore Police Department's technology is currently in "chaos," with police officers using technology that's over twenty-years-old, with no plans to replace aging equipment, according to a report. "Core technologies used by the department are no longer supported by software vendors, with some over 20 years old," reported Ars Technica, who described the department's technology situation as "chaos." "And the Motorola radio system used for mobile communications by the force, including 911 dispatch, will no longer be supported after this year — and there are no plans in place to replace it," they continued. In an investigation into the police department, a survey noted that, "BPD lacks IT policies and procedures." "Where they do exist, policies and procedures are often not followed [or] enforced. This includes a lack of database standards and database documentation that has contributed to grossly unreliable databases of questionable utility," the survey claimed. "Many units within the department have similarly become silos in which individuals have developed business processes that may or may not use certain information systems as intended or have created workarounds to complete analysis that the existing systems cannot do. Alternatively, some units have purchased new systems in an effort to meet their needs." Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

Post-World War I Navigation of Imperialism, Identity, and Nationalism in the 1919-1920 Memoir Entries of Ottoman Army Officer Taha Al-Hāshimī Tomlinson, Jay Sean Fortna, Benjamin Taha al-Hāshimī's memoirs, more akin to a diary or journal, written at the time of observation, contain fascinating entries from the dynamic years 1919-20, including observations of his present and imaginings of the future, during his travels through occupied Ottoman lands in the aftermath of World War I. As a Baghdad-born, Istanbul-educated, Ottoman army officer who remained in Ottoman service through the war, al-Hāshimī offers unique perspectives which bridge many traditionally-understood divisions in historical scholarship. This work consists of a discourse and historical analysis of many of al-Hāshimī's entries during this consequential time and place, focused on three general arguments. First, these entries reveal much about the historical trauma of the foreign conquest of Ottoman lands, as understood and experienced by a committed defender of the Empire. This sentiment is evident in al-Hāshimī's pervasive fears of European colonial policies and in his comparisons of Syria to Algeria and Tunisia, and Iraq to unnamed British colonies in Africa. Second, these entries illustrate seemingly-conflicting and coinciding expressions of both Ottoman and Arab identification. Through both his actions and his entries, al-Hāshimī demonstrates continuity of his Ottoman identity as well as expressions of Arab identity, without predicating it on erasure or de-legitimization of his Ottoman identity. Third, al-Hāshimī's observations of the political environment in Damascus demonstrates a multitude of nationalist activist organizations, both elite and popular, undermining Faysal's government's universalizing claims and dominant position in scholarship. This work supports many recent works arguing for a re-examination of this traditionally marginalized, liminal time. Rather than only a period of disruption, transition, and change, this work argues there are strong episodes of continuity amid uncertain imagined futures.
Google Flights may already be your go-to travel planning app for finding flights. Now there are two new Google search features that make it easier to predict your travel costs before you book. These tools can be useful whether or not you know where you are going. If you use the "Explore" tool on Google Flights, you already know you can see destinations by price after entering your starting airport. Now, you can enter a price ceiling to keep your flight costs below a certain dollar amount. For example, you can enable the filter to only show roundtrip flights under $250. As usual, you can browse destinations looking at the map or the scroll-down menu. You can continue filtering the options by the airline, flight times and the number of stops. It's been possible to compare flight prices by looking at the price graph. Some of the newest flight insights can show you how current prices compare to average prices for the last twelve months. This tool helps you determine if the flight is a good value, average value or is overpriced. You can also have Google Flights track prices for a specific route. When prices drop, you can receive an alert to buy tickets. Don't forget to calculate checked baggage fees into the price. That cheap seat might be a basic economy seat that has baggage and other restrictions. To help prevent you from overlooking this expense, Google Flights has a filter that asks how many carry-ons and checked bags. Google's other travel planning ambitions focus on finding hotels. New filters include finding hotel deals instead of only searching by the nightly rate. You can also search by amenity types, star ratings and a maximum or minimum price window. When you find a hotel you like, click on the property name. You will then see the price from the various travel websites to help you pick the best price or scoop up some loyalty points like with the Capital One Venture and Hotels.com partnership. These new Google features make finding flights and hotels easier as you can see the best prices all in one place. The next time you are planning a trip, don't forget to try these new filters.
New York City is the place to be for creative, contemporary loft interiors, and lucky for NYC this beautiful apartment by happens to be on Manhattan's Bond Street. This eclectic living space features an intriguing mix of modernism and luxury. Earthy textured wall tiles and contemporary art are seen between the classical Romanesque columns, summing up this interior's assorted style. Window walls invite light and the lively city skyline inside, by day and night. Contemporary style furnishings are lovely to look at, yet livable – the perfect combination to achieve fashion and function. A quiet den at the rear features a wrap-around couch which follows the wall of windows, blurring the boundary between indoors and out. Kick back and let time slip away from you, as you watch the world rush by outside. Plush pillows cushion every curve, and a thick, luxurious carpet pampers your toes. The windows feature pull-up charcoal shades, offering views or privacy on demand. We love the combination of warm wood floors and these concrete block walls, and their organic appeal offset by ultra-modern, flamboyant furnishings and art. The variety of materials within this open concept living space make for interesting interiors. From the aforementioned glass, wood and concrete, to the stainless steel kitchen, and the open yet strangely defined dining area, it's certainly an eyeful. We love the dining area set up – a long wood table design, featuring a rich, deep hue and smooth finish, accompanied by pairs of benches on either side and a leather-upholstered dining chair at each far end. The space is topped by a delicious grouping of glass globes, providing decadent dropped display of illumination. Vibrant artwork adorns the crisp, white walls. Bon appetit! Overlooking the dining area, the kitchen dishes up a clean, contemporary aesthetic. The stainless steel backsplash, appliances and lower cabinets anchor the space, while two-toned uppers bring added drama overhead. Behind the kitchen's concrete wall, a recess is occupied by open coat storage – out of the way yet easily at hand. And at last, in the private depths of this dwelling – the bathroom… The designers upped the dose of drama here, with a gently rounded, freestanding bathtub set against a backdrop of cocoa-colored tiled wrapping the space. The second of four bathrooms features a frameless glass shower which offers some separation, but maintains a sense of openness and space. Mirror, mirror on the wall… Elegant integrated lighting beside the vanity is a modern, yet functional feature.
Antonio Brown plays a big role in the Steelers offense, but that won't be his only role in the coming season. Coach Mike Tomlin said Tuesday that the team will use Brown as a punt returner this season as well. There was some thought that the addition of the speedy Dri Archer in the draft would lead to a change in roles for Brown, but Tomlin said that Archer will only be an option for the team alongside Brown. That announcement naturally leads to thoughts about the injury risk that Brown will take on by expanding his portfolio, but Tomlin said that the team won't live in fear of injury when it comes to deploying a player they believe can help them. "He is a Pro Bowl caliber return man, so that's how you play him," Tomlin said of Brown, via the team. There's no question that Brown has skills with two career punt return touchdowns and a 12.8-yard average on returns last season. He's also a Pro Bowl caliber receiver, though, and losing that would likely hurt the Steelers much more than going with Archer or others as the full-time punt return options. Hey Coach Tomlin – He's also a Pro Bowl caliber WR, so be careful with that. Gotta admit him returning kicks is what first stood out to me early on in his career. He runs with such conviction and even when he does get tackled it almost always looks more like a blown block assignment then a bad run. With that being said the writer has a point about the risk/reward side of it and with the combination of having Archer combined with the lack of receiver depth after Brown it might just not be worth it. Best returner in the world. Not even close. Enough already! These guys are football players. Have them play football. He is a very good return man. Returning footballs is a very important part of the game and establishing field position. It's also an area where the inexperienced can turn the ball over. Of course he could get hurt. It's football! Armchair coach's are not very hard to find these days….. sheeze! With all the stupid rule changes including moving the kickoff forward a punt man is much more valuable than a kickoff return man these days. Punt return duties also require quick thinking and decision making — something that can only come with experience. I would guess that Archer will eventually take over but AB is just too good not to put back there at least in important situations. How often are these guys really injured during punt returns anyways? I can't remember the last great offensive player who was injured returning a punt. AB is a great punt return man, right decision. Cant wait to see this guy and the steelers offense have a great year. Get ready to hear TD AB, TD Steelers. Last year Jacoby Jones was out for weeks after he was back waiting to catch a punt because of his own team mate. Stuff happens, it is a risk. I wouldn't want my teams #1 WR taking undue risks. On a related note "Tomlin said he will be on special teams when someone is returning a punt or kickoff for a TD. Also it should be noted since being Tebowed out of the playoffs years ago the steelers have o winning seasons and o playoff appearances since. He could get hurt playing WR too. Maybe they should just put him a glass case with the Lombardi's to make sure he doesn't get hurt? I think this is partially why the Steelers kept 6 wrs on their 53, with two more on the practice squad. This and that almost all of them also play special teams, the exception being Lance Moore. I know the Steelers depth at wr has been questioned by those who don't follow the team closely, but Heyward-Bey has not only found his hands, he has been excellent as a gunner. As has Marcus Wheaton, and solid 6-3 Justin Brown plays on the coverage teams and is also an excellent blocker. Plus Dri Archer gets snaps here too. The team has more depth on it at wr than given credit for, and as usual I don't care what anyone else thinks. So yeah, give the man chance to make big plays. Are we all aware he's in the Hall of Fame as the only player in NFL history to ring up 1000 yards both receiving and in kick returns – in the same year? Well, we are now. The roster is full of HOF'ers and is unparalleled in the NFL. I love reading idiots who suggest giving playmakers less touches unless it is their traditional position. Do you want your playmakers making plays? How do you do that? Give them the ball. Who cares how they get yards, score or make defenses soften to play them honest. Every play has injury potential. Correction to previous post. Stillers actually 3rd best team in their division. The humidity was getting to me. I cant remember the last time I saw a punt returner get hurt. Many more get hurt playing WR. The more important question is whether that makes him more valuable in FF (add return yards) or less valuable (injury risk) ? Wannabe Jacoby Jones, who has destroyed the Steelers the last two years, while Brown has done nothing against the Ravens. Steelers run all y'all. Deal. On a related note trolls are more interested in thumbs down than a free meal at a four star restaurant….. Where is the phoney god bless today? Brown needs to be replaced by Archer to safe guard Ben's best weapon. Tomlin is a blithering idiot & I anxiously await the day when our team is no longer poisoned by his stupidity. Tomlin showing his high I.Q. again lol.

Thanks for sharing some of the firsts for your mom. Yes, it would have been quite the experience to leave Germany for a new and different life in the United States, not knowing anyone but her husband and you. I wonder what she was thinking as you sailed from Bremerhaven. Thank you Janet and you are welcome, I wonder that too, I am going to give my Mom a call this evening and pick her brain and post it! It had to have been very emotional. Thank you for sharing this inspiring story of your mother. I look forward to the next blogs about her. Gini, once again your post has held me in rapt attention to the very end! I love the way you wrote of all the firsts in your Mom's life and I love the way your love and devotion showed through.

Thank you my friend for being there for me.
Orange launched on April 28th 1994, with an ambitious aim - to change the way we communicate with each other. As the fourth company to enter a crowded marketplace, it needed to do things radically differently. By talking in a language people could understand and offering innovative products and services, such as per second billing, Orange put its customers first and left the competition playing catch up. Orange Group serves more than 130 million customers in five continents In June 1996 Orange plc became the youngest company to enter the FTSE-100, valued at 2.4 billion. And by July 1997 Orange had gained one million customers. Since then they have gone from strength to strength, becoming the UK's fastest growing mobile communications company and expanding internationally in countries as diverse as Hong Kong and Israel. Today, the Orange brand is one of the most powerful in the world, and the Orange Group serves more than 175 million customers in five continents. It is the number three mobile operator in Europe and number one provider of broadband Internet services. It's come a long way since launching from its Bristol HQ in 1994.

I was interested to read in our local paper this morning that the town council has issued a request to motorists to take more care in parking in the older parts of the town with very narrow streets. The available road is then often less than 3.20m wide. Emergency vehicles and the like it would appear, are having problems getting past vehicles parked opposite each other. In addition because of this problem of narrow streets, parking with two wheels on pavements (sidewalks) is tolerated, but motorists are supposed to leave a 1m gap between the car and the wall to allow pensioners with wheeled Zimmer frames, wheelchairs, pram pushing mums and children under eight on bicycles to pass without hindrance. Children under eight must use the pavement by law. This gap of 1m is often ignored. At the moment these children are forced out into the road. The town council requests parents, teachers etc. make the law clear to any motorist they find parking so that the pavement is blocked. This might however lead to unpleasant scenes. German motorists are not amused when one points out that they are wrongly parked. In addition cycleways are often regarded as a parking place. I suspect a campaign by the town's parking wardens issuing tickets would be more effective. Even though it might well be political suicide for any council taking this course of action.
Dorian's unbanned once every decade, while Cliff and Sledg are never banned. I can say Rescue has a Marco Cr, but he's banned oh well. Interesting deck. Congrats on the 1300. Ya apparently this deck is still good this week. lost my 1st match in elo(used eddy and futoshi ld) and went back to it and havent lost its 18 wins 0 losses and 2 draws now. Fang Pi Clang with Sphiagi Splash by m i l e s . Posted wednesday 17/04/2013, 02:53 by m i l e s . Rate and comment please. If you could recommend any tips and suggestions, you are most welcome to do so. Thank you for you time! Please don't rate down. Interesting deck. i would personally change Dalhia Cr to Selma (extra damage and I prefer + pillz to - pillz). Not only that, they don't have decent 7-8 power cards. Most of them rely on their bonus to reach the 8 power mark. Freaks, like what the oracle said, relies too much on their first round. I'm pretty sure the dev's plan was create a clan with high power and low damage but most damage comes from the bonus, but sometimes you won't always get a free pass in the first round. IMO : Freaks lack manipulation and damage. Mostly damage. Like pussycats whose main role is supposed to soak damage, they have some great cards with high damage too. Indeed Ulrich does DR La Junta and FPC for 6 but then the Piranas as a whole is pretty weak against them. I don't think La Junta should worry about Ulrich anyway. You didn't help! That's the joke! Well, I only like to use 1 2* in Pussycats, and that is Lucy.

The new building includes a lot of updates that make it more accommodating to seniors.
The Geography of Food looks at the global pattern of food production and consumption. It reveals a complex pattern of global connections. The map of the Geography of food shows a pattern that reflects the dominance of developed countries over developing countries. The map reveals the deeply layered connection between food innovation, its production, transportation, retail and consumption but hides the many environmental and human costs. It shows how agribusiness and supermarkets produce and import food for year-round consumption but indirectly export drought, soil degradation, groundwater exploitation and human dislocation. It shows how developing countries can be both exporters of food yet importers of food aid. The map of the Geography of food reveals a modern day land grab by agribusiness, it shows how the control of food supply is being gently ripped from the hands of local indigeneous people and placed in the control of the corporation. The map shows a rapid increase in food production alongside a growth in food scarcity. The geopoitics of food is complex. Food security for the rich improves alongside its protection and subsidy. At the same time, food security for the poor declines, perhaps as a result of their governments being advised to reduce their own agricultural support. The Geography of food reveals a paradox and hypocrisy and a power relation that profits the corporations to produce vast amounts of food that the poor and vulnerable will never see.
What Does the President's Re-election Mean for Electronic Health Records? With President Barack Obama's re-election most of the remaining uncertainty regarding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act has been lifted and will continue to move forward. Health IT adoption, on which health reform depends was less affected by the results on November 6. The task of replacing paper with electronic health records (EHRs) will continue. The Obama administration's agenda in regard to health information technology and electronic health record adoption has been clear from the start – the President is a supporter of EHRs advancement. Here are some HIT predictions for Obama's second term: Meaningful use stages will continue on course. This was a hot topic and was broadly opposed by several Republicans in the months leading up to the election. With a chance of being reduced or eliminated had Romney won, we can expect to see the Meaningful Use continue on path into stage three after Obama's election. Meaningful Use incentives and EHRs will continue to be questioned whether they are producing results. NCG Medical stresses the fact that Meaningful Use and EHR implementation have in fact been meaningful. The incentives will continue to motivate adoption of new technology and electronic health records will continue to help the nation's health care system. There was not an instant change with the re-election of Obama. Our nation's health care system will continue its growth and see some changes in the future. NCG Medical will continue to provide help every step of the way to make the transition as simple as possible.
When it comes to improving quality of life, almost nothing compares to getting adequate, good quality sleep. We've written plenty of posts that discuss the causes of peripheral neuropathy, potential treatments and lifestyle modifications. As doctors who have cared for people suffering from peripheral neuropathy for many years, one of the most debilitating problems we hear from our patients is their inability to sleep well. More and more scientific evidence is being compiled studying sleep and its benefits to a host of body system functions. Studies have shown that getting good quality sleep helps with controlling blood sugar as well. So, we've pulled together some simple tips to help you get the rest you need. 5. Exercise. But do it during daytime hours. Giving our bodies enough exertion throughout the day can help us sleep better at night. But exercising also helps to release energy-boosting hormones, so stick to an exercise routine that you can accomplish during the morning/early afternoon hours. Studies have consistently shown that adequate sleep at night is associated with reduced pain levels in people who suffer from chronic pain conditions like peripheral neuropathy. And we also know that a good night's rest gives us a much sunnier outlook on the day ahead--important for those with peripheral neuropathy. If you are dealing with peripheral neuropathy and have other healthy tips for sleeping well, please share them with our readers in the comment section on this blog, on our Facebook Page (http://www.facebook.com/NeuraVite) or on Twitter (www.twitter.com/NeuraVite.) Together, we can help each other get the sweet, reparative rest needed to win the fight against peripheral neuropathy symptoms.
The College Football Playoff will offer financial aid to families of players traveling to the national championship, the organization announced on Tuesday. As many as two parents or legal guardians for each player can be reimbursed up to $1,250 per person for lodging, travel and meal expenses.

Preseason top-10 Notre Dame lost to Navy and is now 3-6 Three wins and six losses. By Richard Johnson@RJ_Writes Updated Nov 6, 2016, 9:18am EST Share All sharing options for: Preseason top-10 Notre Dame lost to Navy and is now 3-6 Photo by Michael Hickey/Getty Images Unless you've been living under a rock, devoid of internet connection to this website, or do not possess the ability to appreciate Schadenfreude, you're aware how poorly Notre Dame's season is going. Now it's gone from bad to worse as Navy has knocked off Notre Dame, 28-27, beating the Fighting Irish for the fourth time in 52 years. A moment to backhandedly compliment Notre Dame's defense. A team that is insanely young on defense struggled with an option squad, but that's to be expected. Defending the option is something that takes discipline and focus. You can't be unsound with any of your defensive principles, or you'll get torched. And that goes double if you don't face the system often, which the Irish don't. Navy coach Ken Niumatalolo has built something, and he knows it's here to stay. He told our Alex Kirshner in October: "We're not a one-hit wonder program," Niumatalolo says. "We've been winning for a long time. We're kind of used to it. We're kind of used to, like, 'There's the nice kids that wear their uniforms.' That's fine, however people see us, but we feel like we have a really good football program." Navy rushed for over 300 yards for the fifth time this season as the nation's No. 5 rushing attack did what it does. Notre Dame had six total possessions against Navy. Four in the first half, two in the second half. — Brian Fremeau (@bcfremeau) November 5, 2016 Brian Kelly showed faith in his defense by kicking a field goal with 7:28 left to make the score 28-24, but they didn't come through. And in a moment of sweet irony, Navy iced the game with a pass, converting on fourth down with around one minute left in the game. Read carefully, please, because Navy held the ball for 7:28 to salt this game away, and it wasn't even the longest drive of the day. The Midshipmen also had a nine-minute drive bridging the third and fourth quarter, and had a total time of posession of 20:20 in the second half. Unfortunately, Notre Dame's special teams did what it does as well. And that's damning the Fighting Irish at the worst time. Last week against Miami, four critical blunders nearly gave away a double-digit lead. This week, Navy went the entire game without punting. But the one time it almost did, the Irish committed a blunder. Is there anything Notre Dame has not done on special teams this year? 12-men on the field, reviewed, now Navy gets 4th-and-1. — Irish Illustrated (@PeteSampson_) November 5, 2016 The Midshipmen would convert the ensuing fourth-and-1, then score a touchdown to take a 28-24 lead. But not until the defense followed suit with a 12-men penalty of its own near the goal line. Stopping the option is hard, but you can't just use extra players willy nilly whenever you'd like. So where does this leave Brian Kelly? The seat's been hot under Mr. Kelly's posterior. This team had talent returning and was supposed to be good, if not elite. It is most certainly not either of those things. Last week, he got the dreaded vote of confidence from Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick. #NotreDame AD Jack Swarbrick to @espn: "Brian (Kelly) will lead this team out of the tunnel opening day next year." https://t.co/NbaalLTNL5 — Matt Fortuna (@Matt_Fortuna) October 21, 2016 Cool, right? Your boss is happy with you even though you're not doing a good job! But Kelly told ESPN's Matt Fortuna this week that he actually wasn't too happy with his athletic director's vote of confidence given this week. "Well I was disappointed actually. But anytime that your athletic director has to come out and say that, as a head coach you're disappointed that any kind of comments like that have to be made. So I didn't ask him, that was his decision, but I clearly understand what he was doing. He was probably sick and tired of being sick and tired, too. But for me it's disappointing, certainly, that you have to make those comments." It's OK because no matter what Swarbrick says, if the Irish keep losing games, that vote of confidence will eventually be replaced by a pink slip and a boot straight out of South Bend, even if it's next year.

I don't know about you, but every time we get anything new from Taylor Bennett I'm instantly in a better mood. Maybe that's because of the artists penchant for dropping feel good bangers or maybe it's just that I'm excited for his next project "THE AMERICAN REJECT" to drop. Serving as a warm up to that, Taylor decided to let loose the latest video off the tape for his track "STREAMING SERVICES." Featuring Zxxk and Melo Makes Music, the colorful video perfectly compliments the songs energetic vibe. ​Check out the video now and be sure to be on the lookout for Taylor's next tape dropping sooner than later.
Back to the New England Patriots Newsfeed The Patriots' offense is still a chore, but Thursday finally gave us a glimmer of hope Boston.com | November 25, 2022 Related Topics: New England Patriots, Justin Jefferson For all the good the Patriots (finally) displayed on offense Thursday night in Minnesota, everything else fell apart. Four days after leading New England to a last-second victory over the New York Jets, its special teams bottomed out; directly leading to 14 points for the Vikings off a kickoff return and a costly fourth-quarter penalty on rookie Pierre Strong for running into the punter. The Patriots' secondary, meanwhile, couldn't handle Justin Jefferson (who can?), who torched New England for nine catches for 139 yards and a touchdown. Indeed, "Primetime" Kirk Cousins (299 yards, three touchdowns, one interception) took Thanksgiving night off in leading his team to a 33-26 win, giving the Vikings a commanding five-game lead in the NFC North with only six left to play.

Failure-to-Warn Case Results in $63 Million Verdict A recent case illustrates that victims of adverse reactions to a drug can obtain compensation for their injuries if they are willing to travel the often long and difficult road to victory in the court room against a multi-billion dollar defendant. In February of this year, more than six years after plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson, a Massachusetts jury in Plymouth awarded a young girl and her parents a total of $63 million in compensatory damages (plus $46 million in interest and costs) for damages the girl suffered after taking the Children's Motrin brand of ibuprofen. This case was just the latest in a series of cases filed against the defendant related to a rare and severe allergic reaction that plaintiffs have contended is caused by Motrin. The early cases all resulted in defeat for plaintiffs, but recently the tide has turned in the wake of growing information about children who have suffered similar injuries, with a Pennsylvania case reportedly resulting in a multi-million dollar verdict in late 2011. In this most recent case, the plaintiff child – named Samantha Reckis – was just 7 years old when she was given Motrin for treatment of fever and what appeared to be flu-like symptoms. When her fever spiked, her parents consulted medical professionals who advised that they increase the dosage. The plaintiffs' lawyer contended that this was the worst possible course of action, and that it resulted partly or entirely because the warning label for the Motrin product was inadequate. Brad Henry of Boston's Meehan, Boyle, Black & Bogdanow, successfully explained to a jury that the top layer of Samantha's skin first became inflamed and then began to peel away, essentially leaving her entire body "burned" and exposed to infection. Henry set his sights on proving that the reaction, known as toxic epidermal necrolysis, was actually a rare but well-known side effect for some children who have taken Motrin, a contention that the defendant has refuted in the past. In Samantha's case, she reportedly suffered skin burns and a severely inflamed throat, mouth, eyes, esophagus, intestinal tract, respiratory system and reproductive system, forcing her doctors to put her into a therapeutic coma. The brave young girl also suffered temporary brain damage, permanently lost almost all of her vision, and had her lung capacity significantly and irreversibly reduced, but she battled back from the coma and over a period of years became an honors student at her school. The defendant reportedly asserted after trial that Children's Motrin is "labeled appropriately" and is proven as a "safe and effective treatment option for minor aches, pains and fever," adding that it disagreed with the verdict and would consider remaining legal options (presumably including appeal or settlement for a lesser amount).

"Dr. Kevin A. Imhoff has helped me so much both physically and structurally. I am now pain free and feel so much better overall with my continued maintenance visits. The staff at Capitol Chiropractic is friendly and helpful. I'm so glad my friend recommended me to them!" "I came to Capitol Chiropractic (Dr. Kevin) with a severe pain in my right shoulder (scale of 9 from 1-10). Dr. Kevin diagnosed the problem right away and his procedure healed me within less than 24 hours! Before coming here I thought I would be in physical therapy for the next 6 months, but luckily Dr. Kevin got me back to my normal life and my workouts within 2 appointments. Thank you very much!" "Dr. Oliver has been my chiropractor for many years. She always takes the time to listen to how I'm feeling and address any specific problems I may be experiencing. She individualizes my care and I never feel like she's taking a "One size fits all" approach. I recommend her to anyone seeking chiropractic care." "I've been going to Dr. Oliver for several years and what I most like about her is that she truly cares and she cares about me as a whole person, not just as a diagnosis to "fix." She has helped me and guided me regarding nutrition, exercise, rest, and strengthening. I admire and respect her more than I can put into words. I would recommend her to anyone who truly wants to feel better and wants a chiropractor who will guide them and help them in every way that is right for that individual person in regard to physical and nutritional needs." "It has been my experience over many years at Capitol Chiropractic to receive only positive results from treatment by Dr. Oliver. Her knowledge of anatomy and physiology has been evident in how she applies the best type of treatment for her patients. The staff at Capitol Chiropractic has been and continues to be friendly and professional. They are respectful and do their best to accommodate patient schedules. I would highly recommend Dr. Oliver and Capitol Chiropractic."
On sale date: October 8, 2019 This brutal, original crime thriller graphic novel, from the co-creator of Love and Rockets, tells the story of femme fatale Maria M. Maria M.'s is a sordid tale of sex, drugs, violence, and power. When she comes to America for a better life, she marries a drug kingpin, whose son learns Maria's darkest secret, leading to the most violent gangland bloodbath in organized crime history. Maria M. collects 2013's Book One (now out of print), and the never-before-published Book Two, presenting the complete graphic novel for the first time. Longtime readers of Hernandez's books will recognize a metatwist worthy of Maria M.'s pulpy pages: Maria M. doubles as a "biopic" of the mother of Hernandez's most beloved character: Luba from Love and Rockets! Maria M. is part of the Love and Rockets series. "Hernandez is one of the great craftsmen of modern comics." — New York Times Book Review "Hernandez has become the medium's David Lynch or Guy Maddin, rolling his personal obsessions and freewheeling abstractions into stories that present as pulp, then take some very weird turns." — The A.V. Club "The combination of classic cartooning and cinematic storytelling, as well as graphic sex and violence, pushed to near surrealistic extremes, should satisfy most devotees and inspire the creation of even more." — Library Journal "Maria M. is executed with style, strong and sensitive character development, practiced casual linework, and the kind of gonzo weirdness that defines the Hernandez ethos. This tale feels like the half-remembered dream of a midnight movie, making for a whimsy worth reading." — Publishers Weekly "Every writer should be so lucky to have the imaginative chops that Hernandez shows in Maria M." — Southwest Review 5.9" × 8.6"

Wow, what a year. It's hard to believe we're at the end of 2010 already. This year has really been a great one, and I am grateful for all of the things I was able to experience this year. I learned so much this year and grew in so many ways. Most of all I have to thank my husband Blake for encouraging me, helping me through the hard days, and believing that I can do anything. I would never have started my business if it wasn't for him. I thought it'd be fun to choose my top 10 favorite portrait and top 10 favorite wedding pictures from this year. Each one of these photos are ones I am proud of, and I think they show my style and who I am. I hope you'll enjoy looking back on 2010 with me. In case you don't know, this is actually a picture of me, my husband, my parents, and my siblings. I know it's kind of silly for me to put this in here, but I really do love it. I set up the camera on a tripod and then ran as fast as I could into place. What I love about this picture is the expanse of green above us, as well as the color scheme of our clothes. We spent so long trying to figure out what to wear and finally I came up with this look. It just clicked. I love how just plain silly this is. I mean, who thinks to play Hide and Seek at their family session? I love how the turquoise and lime look with the surroundings. Again, I love the ferns, and the light coming through the trees is almost magical. I love the surroundings here, especially the texture of those mossy pebbles on the ground. I think it's beautiful. But the thing I love most about this photograph, is that I really didn't think I could pull it off. You probably can't tell, but they were standing in dark shade, and the water and land behind them was in the brightest noon-day sun. It would have been so easy to over-expose and ruin the background. I was so scared that I wouldn't be able to make this picture happen, but with the help of Blake and some flashes, I pulled it off. So now this one is one I am quite proud of, and it's made me more confident in my ability. I think what I love most about this one is how funny this family is, and them doing a super 'bad' pose like this just cracks me up. But the thing is, they actually look good doing it. The black and white tops it off. Way to go guys. If you've been following my blog you'll know this is actually an engagement session. But I thought I'd count it as a family portrait, because that's kind of what it is. I love how cute the baby is, and I love how in love the couple looks. Having it in black and white really accentuates the emotion portrayed here. I think this girl is so beautiful. I love the way she put her hand through her hair. The grass popping out of the rocks pretty much makes the photograph. I think her gaze is mesmerizing. Oh the colors! The turquoise she's wearing looks perfect by the yellow wall, and the fact that her eyes are blue and her hair blonde (yellow) make it all the better. And isn't she just a cute little girl! Let's talk about fabulous. The purple color scheme works great with the other colors surrounding them. I love the lush greens and the beautiful flowers. The fact that I captured four kids and a dog looking great in one photograph is awesome. And to top it all off, this picture was taken in their backyard. Gorgeous. It may be a sin to have her as number one and number two, but hey, just look at her. She is seriously the cutest thing ever and this picture captures her just as I remember her: an absolute doll. Her pose is perfect, but I didn't direct her at all! She seriously just posed herself like this when I told her where to sit. The flowers around her set the perfect scene and her adorable little outfit looks perfect. This photograph is just overflowing with cuteness. I hope you enjoyed, and be sure to stay tuned for my top 10 wedding photograph picks for this year!
Q: por que o FloatingActionButton está transparente? Estou com um problema depois que atualizei a lib support.design:22.2.0 para 23.0.1, o floatingActionButton passou a ser transparente quando executado na API 10. Aqui está o código: <android.support.design.widget.FloatingActionButton android:layout_height="wrap_content" android:layout_width="wrap_content" app:borderWidth="0dp" android:src="@drawable/ic_mode_edit_white_24dp" app:layout_anchor="@id/appBar" app:layout_anchorGravity="bottom|right|end" android:elevation="2dp" android:id="@+id/btnClick" app:fabSize="normal" android:backgroundTint="@color/colorFAB" android:layout_gravity="right|bottom" /> A: Me parece que isso é um bug do Android 10 que foi corrigido na versão 14, de uma olhada na issue #183315 mas que apareceu durante a versão 23.0.0 da design library. Existem duas soluções, uma simples e outra que depende de uma sobreescrever o comportamento do FAB. 1) Voltar para a versão 22.2.1. As vezes isso é comum (infelizmente). Se existe um bug da biblioteca, e que não tem solução, basta regredir se não usar nenhuma função específica da versão. 2) Criar uma classe que herda do FloatActionButton da design library como um "workaround", sugerido pelo comentário #9: public class TintFloatingActionButton extends FloatingActionButton implements TintableBackgroundView { static final int[] PRESSED_ENABLED_STATE_SET = {android.R.attr.state_pressed, android.R.attr.state_enabled}; static final int[] FOCUSED_ENABLED_STATE_SET = {android.R.attr.state_focused, android.R.attr.state_enabled}; private static final int[] TINT_ATTRS = { android.R.attr.background }; private TintInfo mBackgroundTint; public TintFloatingActionButton(Context context) { super(context); } public TintFloatingActionButton(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) { super(context, attrs); } public TintFloatingActionButton(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyleAttr) { super(context, attrs, defStyleAttr); if (TintManager.SHOULD_BE_USED) { TintTypedArray a = TintTypedArray.obtainStyledAttributes(getContext(), attrs, TINT_ATTRS, defStyleAttr, 0); if (a.hasValue(0)) { setSupportBackgroundTintList(createColorStateList(a.getResourceId(0, -1))); } a.recycle(); } } private static ColorStateList createColorStateList(int selectedColor) { final int[][] states = new int[3][]; final int[] colors = new int[3]; int i = 0; states[i] = FOCUSED_ENABLED_STATE_SET; colors[i] = selectedColor; i++; states[i] = PRESSED_ENABLED_STATE_SET; colors[i] = selectedColor; i++; // Default enabled state states[i] = new int[0]; colors[i] = Color.TRANSPARENT; i++; return new ColorStateList(states, colors); } @Override public void setSupportBackgroundTintList(ColorStateList tint) { if (mBackgroundTint == null) { mBackgroundTint = new TintInfo(); } mBackgroundTint.mTintList = tint; mBackgroundTint.mHasTintList = tint != null; applySupportBackgroundTint(); } @Nullable @Override public ColorStateList getSupportBackgroundTintList() { return mBackgroundTint != null ? mBackgroundTint.mTintList : null; } @Override public void setSupportBackgroundTintMode(@Nullable PorterDuff.Mode tintMode) { if (mBackgroundTint == null) { mBackgroundTint = new TintInfo(); } mBackgroundTint.mTintMode = tintMode; mBackgroundTint.mHasTintMode = tintMode != null; applySupportBackgroundTint(); } @Nullable @Override public PorterDuff.Mode getSupportBackgroundTintMode() { return mBackgroundTint != null ? mBackgroundTint.mTintMode : null; } private void applySupportBackgroundTint() { if (getBackground() != null && mBackgroundTint != null) { TintManager.tintViewBackground(this, mBackgroundTint); } } } Código completo neste gist: https://gist.github.com/arturgaleno/5cca1934ed324bd2d9a7
Tucker Carlson Goes to Church to Tee Up a Holy War Over the last few years we've watched as Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, and Lou Dobbs have competed for the title of "most avowed white nationalist on Fox News." Personally, I don't know who I would vote for because they have all been deplorable. But Tucker Carlson is in the process of adding to his repertoire. He traveled to Tennessee in October to speak at a church in Nashville and, as he says in the video below, it was the first time he has addressed a congregation. The point of Carlson's speech was to suggest that the polarized divide we are experiencing in the country these days is not political, but theological. In his framing, it all comes down to whether you believe that God is in charge and humans are powerless. That is the beginning of a classic authoritarian framework, which leaves a certain class of people in charge of enlightening the rest of us about God's intentions. But I am most interested in why Carlson, who claims to be a traditional Episcopalian, would find this a good time to frame the issues that divide us as theological. We all know that he has garnered the support of the white nationalists who are part of Trump's base. The other group that has unequivocally supported the president are white evangelical Christians—who no doubt overlap with white nationalists to some degree. So it probably shouldn't surprise us that Carlson is now reaching out to that audience as well. As we've seen recently, Trump is starting to lose ground in terms of support—both in Congress and with voters. It is not in his nature to adapt, so we can expect him to simply double-down as the pressure mounts. He'll need the support of his most ardent followers going forward, which is why we'll see tweets like this pop out of the woodwork. Numerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible. Starting to make a turn back? Great! Of course that is all nonsense, as Mark Chancey explains. The need to shore up support from white evangelical Christians was also demonstrated by Sarah Huckabee Sanders' interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network where she said: "I think God calls all of us to fill different roles at different times and I think that he wanted Donald Trump to become President, and that's why he's there. I think he has done a tremendous job in supporting a lot of the things that people of faith really care about." As the president feels increasingly threatened, we'll be seeing a lot more of this in an attempt to shore up Trump's support among white evangelical Christians and convince them that the president is engaged in some kind of holy war. That is precisely why Tucker Carlson left the comfort of his television studio and went to church. Nancy LeTourneau Nancy LeTourneau is a contributing writer for the Washington Monthly.

A section of Ashfield along Parramatta Road was acquired and demolished for WestConnex. The exit to the M4 tunnel will be opposite Bunnings Warehouse near the crossroads of Frederick St/ City West Link and Parramatta Road. Some of the issues raised in relation to WestConnex in Haberfield include home acquisitions, destruction of heritage architecture, noise and vibrations for homes adjacent to construction sites, changes to traffic flows and the impact of all of these factors on the nature of the suburb. WestConnex unused land should be handed back say inner west residents. Residents in Haberfield and Beverley Hills claim WestConnex work is cracking walls of houses near motorway construction sites. ​Urban dynamics have shaped the city of Sydney. Over time the economic character, nature and location of land has changed. Economic character refers to how much particular areas, or pieces of land are worth. Nature refers to the type or kind of use. For example, within residential land there can be a variety of housing, or within commercial land there can be a variety of different type of shopping centres, malls, office buildings, etc. Location refers to the way in within land use is distributed throughout the city.

SEHK:927 Will the Promising Trends At Fujikon Industrial Holdings (HKG:927) Continue? To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Fujikon Industrial Holdings (HKG:927) so let's look a bit deeper. Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Fujikon Industrial Holdings: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.013 = HK$9.3m ÷ (HK$1.0b - HK$296m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2020). Therefore, Fujikon Industrial Holdings has an ROCE of 1.3%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Consumer Durables industry average of 16%. Check out our latest analysis for Fujikon Industrial Holdings SEHK:927 Return on Capital Employed February 5th 2021 Historical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for Fujikon Industrial Holdings' ROCE against it's prior returns. If you want to delve into the historical earnings, revenue and cash flow of Fujikon Industrial Holdings, check out these free graphs here. What Does the ROCE Trend For Fujikon Industrial Holdings Tell Us? While there are companies with higher returns on capital out there, we still find the trend at Fujikon Industrial Holdings promising. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 463% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking. The Bottom Line On Fujikon Industrial Holdings' ROCE In summary, we're delighted to see that Fujikon Industrial Holdings has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. Since the stock has only returned 33% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term. Fujikon Industrial Holdings does have some risks though, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Fujikon Industrial Holdings that you might be interested in.

Life coaching has become nothing less than a phenomenon. The Harvard Business Review reported that coaching is a $1 billion a year industry. People who work as "coaches" have a simple goal: to help you advance your career, start life as an entrepreneur or help you create a better, more fulfilling life. Sounds good, right? But how can we trust the coaching itself? And isn't a lot of the coaching superficial - like a self-help book? Thankfully, we have access to the ultimate life coaching from God in the deepest, most transforming areas of life. The areas that shape our 24-hour day, our relationships, our families, our jobs. James Emery White brings the Bible's teaching, along with more than 30 years of experience as a life coach, to bear in a way never packaged before. Based on clear biblical principles, this series offers a clear and distinct coaching tool that can be used to instantly diagnose a life and ultimate life change.

The premise is simple, you take a car that is commonly considered ugly that you think looks cool. ill start off with the Volkswagen Thing. Lexus IS250F Sport. Really like the V6 and the unsettled handling style. Also 4th gen, but I don't really like it as much after the 1998 facelift. That looked like an awkward and riced out Mitsubishi FTO… but it's a Supra? Wtf? It's real JDM brah, love it or hate it. Here's a game of Spot the supercar! From the outside appearance, it is certainly outlandish, but not entirely out of this world. Just not appropriate for what it is. It's not looking like it used to, not looking like it should, not like the lame hybrid granny-mover most know it as. Now… it became rice. It possibly just needs more power to justify the looks! I actually agree with 4LGE, to some extent. I think that the body of the Prius looks very athletic and sleek, certainly a large improvement from the old ones. Of course, the fixtures are just totally fugly, but the Prime version of the Prius improves on this aspect quite a lot.
Q: React Router v4 not loading component For some reason, my web app is not directing to the component whenever I go to the parameters. Specifically, it is not going to the Battle component. Here is what the navigation looks: import React from 'react'; import Header from './components/Header/Header'; import SelectPlayers from './pages/SelectPlayers/SelectPlayers'; import Popular from './pages/Popular/Popular' import Battle from './pages/Battle/Battle' import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link, Switch } from "react-router-dom"; function App() { return ( <Router> <div className={'flex flex-column'}> <Header /> <Switch> <Route exact path={'/'} component={Popular}/> <Route exact path={'/battle/select-player'} component={SelectPlayers} /> <Route exact path={'/results?playerOne=:playerOne&playerTwo=:playerTwo'} component={Battle} /> </Switch> </div> </Router> ); } export default App; In the SelectPlayers component, whenever the user presses a button it runs: import React, {useState} from 'react'; function SelectPlayers(props) { const [playerOne, setPlayerOne] = useState(''); const [playerTwo, setPlayerTwo] = useState(''); function setPlayerName(event, player){ if (player === 1){ setPlayerOne(event.target.value) } else if (player === 2) { setPlayerTwo(event.target.value) } } function goToBattle(event){ event.preventDefault(); props.history.push(`/results?playerOne=${playerOne}&playerTwo=${playerTwo}`) } return ( <div className={'pa3 mh7-l mh7-m'}> <div className="flex flex-column"> <div className={'mb1'}> <h1 className={'mb0'}>Player One</h1> <input onChange={(e) => setPlayerName(e, 1)} type="text" placeholder={'github username'} className={'input-reset pa1 w-100 h2 ba b--black br2'}/> </div> <div className="tc dark-red"> <h1>Versus</h1> </div> <div className={'mb3'}> <h1 className={'mb0 mt0 tr'}>Player Two</h1> <input onChange={(e) => setPlayerName(e, 2)} type="text" placeholder={'github username'} className={'input-reset pa1 w-100 h2 ba b--black br2'}/> </div> <div> <button onClick={(e) => goToBattle(e)} className={'input-reset pa1 h2 fw1 bg-black white ba w-100 b--black br2'}>Battle</button> </div> </div> </div> ); } export default SelectPlayers; On the Battle component, I write some console.log stuff just to check if the Component loaded. However, whenever I go to that parameter, none of the code in my componentDidMount is running. I don't see any of the console.logs I wrote in componentDidMount in my developer console. Here is the component: import React, {Component} from 'react'; class Battle extends Component { constructor(props){ super(props) } componentDidMount() { console.log('runngins'); console.log(this.props); } render() { return ( <div className={'pa3 mh7-l mh7-m'}> <div className="flex flex-column"> </div> </div> ); } } export default Battle; You can see the code at this repo: https://github.com/tarekgabarin/github_compete It would be greatly appreciated if anyone helped me. A: As per your new comment that code is working without queryset, looks like there is some problem with your queryset parameters. As suggested in comment box, don't define Router with queryset. <Switch> <Route exact path={'/'} component={Popular}/> <Route exact path={'/battle/select-player'} component={SelectPlayers} /> <Route exact path={'/results'} component={Battle} /> </Switch> In your SelectPlayers component, navigate to next page with queryset. props.history.push("/results?playerOne=" +playerOne+ "&playerTwo=" +playerTwo) On Battle component, use (query-string) to read the parameter. For example: const values = queryString.parse(this.props.location.search); const player_one = values.playerOne const player_two = values.playerTwo Please note that my above code is not tested. Thanks
It's said that the first recorded recipe in human history was for a beer-like beverage. Some anthropologists suggest that the reason our ancestors gave up the relatively easy hunter-gatherer lifestyle in favor of an agricultural one was to allow time for alcohol to ferment. Regardless of how true these "facts" may be, beer is pretty damned integral part of human history. That's something I like to remind myself of when I'm scrubbing my fermenter for what seems like the thousandth time. I am a home brewer. My fingers are stained with santizer and my fridge reeks of hops. Pretty much any spare storage space in my house is packed with brewing equipment and ingredients. I cringe at the sight of people putting cigarette butts into bottles, wondering how they can sully such a perfectly good longneck. I do, indeed, have a beard. A certain historical figure might have turned water into wine, but I turn water, grain, hops and yeast into delicious ales on the regular. And you can too. You, too, can look down your nose at your local's beer draft selection! The best thing about brewing beer is that it's way, way easier than people would have you believe. If you can follow a recipe and get your hands on about 400 RMB worth of equipment, you're good to go. Best yet, it's now easier and cheaper than ever to do it right here in Ningbo, thanks to people like Eddy Dong, who runs his own homebrew supply shop out of Shenyang, Liaoning province with his wife. Here's a link to that shop. NG: Tell us about yourself, Eddy. ED: I love brewing and home brewing, first time I get to know about home brewing was in 2012. My main job is IT. NG: Tell us a little about your business. ED: Me and my wife own a bar in Shenyang and we created our own brand "Duo Jie Home Brewing Equipment Shop". Now our shop has become pretty well-known in the homebrewing industry in China. A lot of people buy our ingredients, and some of them bought our tailored ingredient packages (editor's note: these are kits Eddy will put together for you to make a certain style of beer if you're not comfortable doing that yourself) and won some pretty prestigious prizes at home brewing competitions. NG: How did you get started in the homebrew business? ED: At the beginning, we imported ingredients and equipment from abroad and we brewed our own beer, then we started to import for our friends. After that it was a pretty logical move to open our own shop. NG: Why do you think homebrew gotten more popular among not just foreigners in China but Chinese people as well? ED: First of all, a lot of people first tasted the home brewed beer and realized how bad the beers we see at the stores are. Then they started looking for good beers. The imported craft beers are usually pretty expensive, so start brewing their own beer is a better option for them. Use the right ingredients, follow the recipe, it cost less money when you brew your own beer at home and taste great—easily on par with the imported ones. On the other hand, young people find it fun to be creative and make beer in the way they want to make it and are trying many different ways to brew beers. NG: What advice do you have for people who want to get into brewing beer? ED: If you have someone to teach you how to brew beer, you are lucky*. If you brew by yourself with no other help, it's better to read some books, forums, and other related information. Don't rush to make a decision and start it without knowing about brewing. Join some QQ group, talk to people and ask questions. Buy the necessary equipment all at once so you can avoid ending up buying same equipments twice and waste money on it. Invite your friends to join you when you start brewing, share your experience (and beer) with your friends so that you have people to help you keep up the habit! NG: What do you see in the future of craft beer in China? ED: In recent years the craft beer culture is developing very fast. Many people start brewing at home, and you're starting to see many craft beer associations popping up. There has been a craft beer brewing contest every year for the last three years. Also, in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Wuhan, Chengdu, Nanjing, people opened many craft beer shops and bars. They sell home brewed beer or imported craft beer, and the decorations of the shops are amazing. On the business side, there aren't certain clear laws about craft beers yet, so you can expect the craft beer industry to be effected by national law somehow in the future. While there are plenty of folks online selling everything you need to make a zesty IPA, Eddy combines a huge selection, great prices and relentlessly awesome service (in English!) to be the only guy I go to anymore. Add him on WeChat (QR Code just below) and he'll make sure you get everything you need to get started right away. Seriously, great guy. Great advice. Great service. Add him on WeChat. *be on the lookout for a homebrew class starting up soon! We'll keep you posted.
You can leave a dog in a car. You can leave a cake in a car. But you can't leave a dog and a cake in a car. Unless you really wanted to see how cute a dog looks with cake crumbs in her beard. Trust me when I say that it's so cute you can't even be mad about only having 75% of your cake left.
'You can't sell a sunset' Scott Silver photo courtesy Wild Wilderness Scott Silver is the founder of Wild Wilderness, an anti-fee organization based in Bend,Ore.: "The Forest Service is looking at industrial strength recreation as their new business and us as their customers. More and more, the Forest Service is putting itself in between (the public) and nature. All the pull-outs have been McDonalds-ized - with all the kiosks and signs, it's like the golden arches. "You can't sell a sunset, but if you put an interpretive sign in front of a tree, you've suddenly created a product, and you can include the vista in that. Interpretation is such an important part of the new recreation agenda. It's basically leveraging; it's putting the smallest investment in possible, and then using it to sell the entire product. "I think the land managers see no other option. Everyone from the General Accounting Office to the environmental community has just hammered on the Forest Service for its financial incompetence. They see their budgets being cut, and they don't see that there's anything else to do other than adopt this new entrepreneurial spirit. The attitude is if we're not going to log it, mine it or graze it, there must be other ways we can get money out of it. "What worries me about turning the Forest Service into a bunch of entrepreneurs is that it prejudices the decision of the local forest manager. Our public lands don't have to be run as self-supporting. As a society, we can make the decision to fund these agencies."

UK liquids production rose by 27 thousand b/d m/m to 1.03 mb/d in December 2018, despite output being curtailed by an unplanned outage at Buzzard lasting from 19 November to 17 December. Production was higher y/y by 0.24 mb/d, owing to December 2017's shutdown of the Forties Pipeline System (FPS). Across 2018, UK production averaged 1.00 mb/d, higher y/y by just 17 thousand b/d, compared with our early 2018 expectations of 0.1 mb/d of growth, as incremental output from new projects was mostly offset by steep declines and unplanned outages at older fields. In 2019, we expect UK liquids production growth to accelerate to around 70 thousand b/d y/y, buoyed by the start-up of the 0.12 mb/d Clair field in November 2018 and a slew of 2019 start-ups totalling 0.1 mb/d of peak capacity. January 2019 production should come in higher m/m given higher loading programmes for January at 0.43 mb/d for Brent and Forties combined (+78 thousand b/d m/m). Loadings remain flat m/m in February, before rising to 0.46 mb/d in March. Nonetheless, despite higher production, North Sea differentials have strengthened with Brent spreads largely moving back into backwardation, driven by a sustained demand for cargoes from the east. Moreover, with WTI-Brent rallying alongside USGC grades, we expect less US exports to head to Europe, also supporting North Sea balances, at least until the weather disruptions along the Turkish straits ease. UK oil demand rose y/y by 48 thousand b/d to 1.56 mb/d in November, with growth logged across the barrel. Refinery runs fell m/m by 57 thousand b/d to total 1.20 mb/d, though were still higher y/y by 38 thousand b/d, the fifth consecutive month of y/y gains. Runs were still 40 thousand b/d lower y/y in the year to November, owing to heavy H1 18 maintenance.
The Washington Capitals beat the Colorado Avalanche 4-3 (OT) Thursday night at Capital One Arena. The win improves the Capitals record to 30-18-6 (66 points) on the season. The Capitals return to the ice on Saturday when they host the Florida Panthers at Capital One Arena. Puck drop is set for 7:00 PM. The Capitals opened the scoring with a goal from Andre Burakovsky for a 1-0 lead at the first intermission. The Avs tied the game just 35 seconds into the second period, but Evgeny Kuznetsov would register a power play goal midway through the middle frame to give the Caps a 2-1 lead at the second break.

The world's largest Victoria's Secret is located in Herald Square on Broadway in New York City. This iconic member of New York's retail flagship fleet gained its "world's largest" designation after being reimagined and renovated in October 2012. That renovation doubled the store's original size, from 30,000 square feet to 60,000 square feet. As of June 2016, it was still the world's largest Victoria's Secret brick-and-mortar retail location, measured in square footage. It sounds like an oxymoron, but, the Herald Square Flagship Store is not the only Victoria's Secret Flagship Store in the world. Technically, according to the definition of flagship stores, any store that is the first to be opened in any state (or any country) is a "flagship" store. A replica of Victoria's Secret star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Victoria's Secret is the only company, or brand, with a Hollywood "star"

With the tiring academic schedule and exhausting examinations that you face as an engineering student, you need a refreshing break now and then to lift your spirits. This can vary from catching a movie with your buddies to playing your favourite sport. But doing these activities will just help you to relax and escape from your day-to-day schedule. It will not help you to restore your spirit and boost the innovator within you. So, if you want to bring back the innovator within you for which you set out to pursue engineering initially, you need to do some activities that will spark your curiosity towards latest technologies. Most engineering students go for technical festivals that happens at various reputed institutions and participate in some technical events to achieve this. Attending the technical festivals that are hosted by premier institutions like IITs will give you a very good exposure to the latest technological advancements and takes you closer to the innovations happening all across the globe. You can also attend the robotics workshops that are conducted as part of their technical festival to get good technical knowledge and hands-on experience on latest robotics technologies. As robotics is one of the most researched technology today, participating in such workshops will make you understand the current industrial trends and advancements in an exciting manner. These robotics workshops will not only help you to acquire latest technological knowledge but also increase your curiosity & desire to learn new technical concepts and bring out the innovator within you. We have seen a number of instances where a lot of students got influenced by attending such innovative robotics workshops in IITs and developed a thirst to participate in national level robotics competitions to showcase their skills. In this article, I am suggesting some tips for you to make the most out of robotics workshops in IITs. So why you should attend robotics workshops in IITs? How can you register for these robotics workshops? Since the technical festivals organized by the IITs attract a huge crowd, you need to register for these robotics workshops well in advance to confirm your participation. Going for on-spot registration for these robotics workshops is not recommended. As these technical festivals happening in IITs attract a large number of engineering students across the nation, the organizers of such fest will launch their official websites at least 2-3 months prior. You can go through their website to find information about the workshops and register directly. You can also subscribe to their website newsletter or follow their official social media pages to get timely updates about such robotics workshops in IITs. There are also various public forums available that lists the workshop details, you can check their pages periodically to stay updated. For instance, Skyfi Labs also organizes various technical workshops as part of the technical festivals of IITs, NITs and other esteemed universities. Whenever such technical workshops are scheduled, the details will be updated in our website. Therefore, students who are looking to attend such workshops can check the details with our forum and register directly with ease. Know your facts - Although these workshops are organised in IITs, they are not organized by IITs: Yes, don't get fooled and attend them thinking they are organized by IITs (especially those in techfests). The techfest organizers (students mostly) invite other companies to conduct these workshops. Most of the times, the companies who pay more to the organizers get a chance to conduct these. And so they are not conducted by IITs. These workshops don't give IIT Certificates: IIT has nothing to do with these workshops and they are organized by techfest teams who invite other private companies to conduct them. So the certificate you get is from the company (and maybe the techfest and not from IIT). A lot of students think it is IIT certificate and make mistake. Don't do that. Quality is not guaranteed just because workshop is happening in IIT: As I mentioned above, the workshops are not conducted by IIT faculty and are conducted by private companies who pay a lot of amount to the techfest organizers to get this slot. So the quality you get will be the same level as the quality of the organizing company. So instead of blindly going thinking it is IIT, we suggest you to look at the organizing company and do some research about their quality standards. You might ask does IIT not take care of this before allowing them? – Unfortunately from what we observed, they don't. IITs don't even know who are the faculty coming to these workshops and what content they are going to teach. A number of times various companies approached us asking to send out trainers to the workshops they have agreed to conduct in IITs! Don't attend such events!

HSS: Vestiges / Panopticon Split LP - new Panopticon track streaming! Vestiges / Panopticon Split LP - new Panopticon track streaming! A new split LP from two of the best bands in extreme music today - Washington D.C.'s Vestiges and Kentucky's one-man band Panopticon. Two tracks from Vestiges, and three from Panopticon, all of which represent some of each band's strongest output to date. Tracks "VII" and "VIII" are the latest in Vestiges ongoing narrative centered around the relationship between man and nature. These tracks are definitely the darkest and strongest in their already powerful discography. Absolutely mind-blowing, These two tracks have been streaming via the Vestiges website as well as their Bandcamp for months now - if you haven't checked them out, do so now. The Panopticon tracks are also very impressive, and are some of the most beautiful and captivating material that Austin has released. "A Letter" and "Eulogy" sound heavily influenced by post-rock, and have a similar vibe to the songs on the recent split with Wheels Within Wheels. Soaked in atmopshere, melancholy, and decidedly poignant. The third Panopticon track is a very dark and emotional cover of Suicide Nation - the punk/metal band from Tempe, Arizona that broke up in the early 2000's - called "Collapse and Die." If you're familiar with the original, you'll know that this is really terrific; it pays homage to the original while bringing its own fury and meaning. We are very proud and honored to be streaming this track for you, below. This split is a vinyl-only release handled by The Flenser and Vestiges' own label, Replenish Records. All of the tracks were mastered by Colin Marston, who also mixed the Panopticon tracks. The LP is packaged in a gatefold cover with stunning artwork by Alex Mody, and comes with an 11" x 17" poster. Each label has its own color blend for the records - The Flenser's copies will be on electric blue vinyl with black in the center, while Replenish's copies will be on electric blue vinyl with black splatter. Both editions are limited to 300. Black vinyl, limited to 600, is also available. Preorder from The Flenser here and preorder from Replenish here. Both labels are awesome, and are friends of ours, so we encourage you, if you have the means, to order from both. I will be. While you're ordering your copy from The Flenser, you have an opportunity to also pick up a second pressing of Panopticon's latest full-length, Kentucky, on a beautiful 2xLP. With the first pressing long-since sold out, people have been screaming for a second press, and it is now coming to fruition. This time, it's a 2xLP in a single sleeve with an insert and new custom matrix. Co-released with Panopticon's label Lundr records. If you missed out the first time, now is your chance to have it on wax, where it obviously sounds phenomenal.
A: The events that occur from the beginning of one heart beat to the beginning of next constitute a cardiac cycle. It can be divided into three phases (contraction of heart is called systole and relaxation is known as diastole). 1. Atrial Systole (0.1 sec): When the atria are filled with blood, action potential generates in sinoatrial node. Thus a wave of systole spreads over the atria. Hence atria contract. from right atrium flows into right ventricle. The oxygenated blood from left atrium flows into left ventricle. closed (to prevent backward flow of blood into atria) causing the first heart sound lub. oxygenated blood from left ventricle flows into the systemic arch. 3. Cardiac Diastole (0.4 sec): Now the ventricles relax. Thus pressure falls, resulting in the closure of semilunar valves at the bases of aortic arches causing second heart sound dup. When the pressure falls further, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves open and blood from atria flows into ventricles freely. At this phase all the four chambers of heart are in relaxed state. Soon another cardiac cycle sets in.
Beautiful colors and light texture allows light to penetrate into the room. Adds a nice atmosphere to the space. I was afraid it was not going to look like the picture but when it came I was super excited! Love this curtain it is beautiful. The picture is not distorted and does not look cheap.
Even if you have perfect, straight white teeth, you may be concerned that aging skin and facial wrinkles may take away from your smile. But there's no reason to let aging and damaged skin bring your smile down. At New Era we are pleased to offer cosmetic injections that can safely and effectively reduce the signs of aging and have you smiling again in no time. Botox® is a time-tested, FDA-approved cosmetic filler that can help smooth facial wrinkles and give you a younger-looking and radiant smile. Botox® is the first and only FDA-approved preventive treatment for chronic migraines and facial pain. Unlike acute treatments, which are taken to treat a headache or migraine once it's already begun, Botox® prevents headaches and migraines before they even start. Botox® is also being used more and more as an alternative treatment for TMJ (temporo-mandibular joint) disorders and associated jaw tension and pain. When injected into facial muscles afflicted with soreness and discomfort, Botox® relieves jaw tension for many patients. The injections often eliminate headaches resulting from teeth grinding, and, in cases of severe stress, Botox® can even minimize locked jaw. Although Botox® treatment for these conditions is presently experimental, evidence indicates that it can be extremely effective. Laser muscular therapy and deep tissue therapy utilizing the Epic Biolase Diode laser can be used along with Botox® injections, and most patients have reported a significant improvement in their symptoms.

People talk about whether knowledge or experience is better – I believe that knowledge is better but the experience matters too. Michel passed his CCIE lab exam recently, Daniel is close to taking the exam. I say this piece of conversation on Twitter. I have to admire the openness and good humour of these men. Daniel already knows the answer of course, but Michel is making a good point. Knowing all the theory in the world will not necessarily make you the best engineer. Equally, having all the experience in the world will not make you the best engineer. It's possible that there are jobs where either of these is true. Maybe having twenty five years of experience on X25 is still useful. Or maybe knowing the X25 protocol in full detail so as to build X25 terminal software is important. But having both experience and knowledge leads to wisdom. Knowing what you can and cannot do, helps to make the right choice. Practical experience means being able to fit into a team, and learning how to communicate, fill out the paperwork, making better technical choices, understanding how technologies move through acceptance to death, and so much more. Good post Greg. This is very true. I'm just about to start at a new employer with more senior work and network design involved. Getting a CCIE won't do a lot for my career at the moment, it will lead to respect among others of course but with that respect comes also expectations. I plan to see this thing through but there is this thing called life that you don't know what will get thrown at you so whatever the result I will definately not regret the studying. The learning experience is tremendous whether I get a cert or not. Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit. Experience is knowing not to put it in a fruit salad. It is difficult to gain experience without also gaining knowledge. It is rather trivial to gain knowledge with no experience.
How The Financial System Is Being Used To Disempower Us Tags: Banking, Federal Reserve A way in which we can conceptualise the banking system is by imagining 100 people all being given $100 and as a result of this they are expected to pay back $110 at the end of the month. The only way in which you can earn extra money is by earning it from someone else in this group of 100. So there is $10000 in circulation, but $11000 needs to be paid back. In the best of situations this would mean 10 people would end up with nothing and go bankrupt, and the other 90 would be able to continue the cycle. But in our current system it does not work in this way as there is such inequality. It is more like 10 people have $5000 each and the 90 get $55.55 each, but still need the $110 at the end of the month. So as a result they have to borrow the extra $54.45 from one of the 10 with $5000 to keep on going, but for this to happen they will need to pay more interest and the never ending cycle continues. The central reserve banks create money which are not backed by anything tangible, meaning there is no gold or asset supporting it, it is generated from nothing. They then put interest on that money, loan it to the banks and add their fees. The banks then loan it to the people and add interest. The money can never be paid back, as there is not enough money in circulation to pay back the debt. It is like one giant ponzi scheme that will eventually collapse. This has ramifications on an individual level, but it is so much more far reaching than that. Because the debt keeps growing, the only way to keep feeding the system is through aggressive growth of industry. This comes at the expense of the environment, human rights and anything that can damage profits. Our government is supported and influenced by this system and as a result the majority of the problems we face can be linked back to the financial sector. Halliburton a company that have armed multiple sides of global conflicts for nearly 100 years made $39.5 billion from the Iraq War (a bill picked up in part by taxpayers), they also had Dick Cheney as their CEO before he became vice president, Dick Cheney was very vocal on why we should go to war in Iraq. Does anyone see the conflict of interest here? Education is provided to keep this system flowing and science for the most part is funded by organisations that have agendas. We literally have a system that is created to serve a very small group who want to disempower us, so they can continue with their abuse. The groups that are creating this mess are by definition parasites.

@sirphenom I did, but the fact that their servers can still see the conversations was a turn-off. I really should mention it in the article. @levisan Hmm... didn't know that. I was told it was HIPAA compliant too - oh well.
AYUCR's booster section is much like the booster section on any high-power rocket. There are a couple of interesting things I think are worth mentioning though. The original design for the booster called for baffled motor ejection to eliminate the need for wadding, a replacable forward section in case of damage on landing and a 29mm motor mount. The first two decisions were good ones, the last one was not. I severely underestimated the finished weight of the whole thing and ended up with a booster that could barely lift the rocket off the ground. Back to the drawing board. Baffled motor ejection was basically used because I hate wadding. The cellulose insulation that many people use doesn't seem to work well unless you use a lot of it. I have had success with baffling in the past and since I was designing this rocket from the ground up I decided to use it. The motor mount tube would be pluged at the top. The motor ejection gases would escape from holes in the side of the motor mount tube into a compartment between the motor tube and the airframe. The gas would then escape through holes in the forward centering ring. I painted all surfaces along the path with Rustoleum High Heat Enamel to try to protect the surfaces over time. I cannot say if this has worked or not because I cannot get at the inside of the booster to inspect. It seemed like it couldn't hurt.
Joan Of Bar Tag Archives: Joan of Bar Heroines of the Medieval World by Sharon Bennett Connolly On Saturday, 14th October, Conisbrough Castle was the venue for my first talk after the release of my book, Heroines of the Medieval World. In the glorious sunshine, the Castle looked spectacular, the ideal setting for a history talk. I grew up just 5 miles from Conisbrough Castle and so, as a child, every summer holiday included a picnic at the castle and a climb to the top of the keep. As a student I volunteered at the castle, helping out at events and giving guided tours to school groups. In those days, the castle was just a shell, with green slime on the walls, but now it has floors inside, a roof to protect it from the elements and visual displays throughout. The Visitor Centre has a small museum with a cartoon strip telling the castle's story and interactive displays for the kids. Conisbrough Castle's only claim to fame seemed to be its link to Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe, in which it played the part of a Saxon stronghold. Conisbrough Castle, South Yorkshire, built by Hamelin and Isabel de Warenne in the late twelfth century. (Heroines of the Medieval World, Amberley Publishing) However, Conisbrough had been very much a Norman stronghold since the Conquest, given as a prize to one of William the Conquerors' most loyal followers, William de Warenne, first earl of Warenne and Surrey. My talk took place on the 951st anniversary of the Battle of Hastings, the day the Castle changed hands. On the morning of the battle, it belonged to Harold II, but by the end of the day Harold had lost the kingdom and his life and Conisbrough was a prize of war. Heroines of the Medieval World looks at the lives of the women – famous, infamous and unknown who broke the mould. Those who defied social norms and made their own future, consequently changing lives, society and even the course of history. Four of the women in the book had strong connections with Conisbrough Castle, and so it seemed appropriate to hold my first talk and book signing at my 'home' castle. Roche Abbey, final resting place of Maud Clifford, Countess of Cambridge. (Heroines of the Medieval World, Amberley Publishing) My talk concentrated on these four women, telling the stories of their lives and explaining their links to this magnificent castle. The first was Isabel de Warenne, great granddaughter of the first Earl of Warenne and Surrey. Isabel was one of the greatest heiresses in England and it was her second husband, Hamelin, who was responsible for building the keep we still see today. The second Heroine was Joan of Bar, neglected wife of the last de Warenne Earl of Surrey. She was followed by Isabel of Castile, who gave birth to her son, Richard of Conisbrough, Earl of Cambridge, within the castle walls and thus became the matriarch of the York dynasty which would rule England under Edward IV, Edward V and Richard III. And the last was Maud de Clifford, widow of Richard of Conisbrough, who lived out her life at the castle and was buried at nearby Roche Abbey, and who had family on both sides of the Wars of the Roses. The talk was aimed at demonstrating the many links that Conisbrough Castle has to the major events in English medieval history, from the Norman Conquest, to the disastrous reign of Edward II and the civil war which became known as the Wars of the Roses. Conisbrough Castle and its former residents have a rich history and it was a pleasure to bring just a few moments of it to life. Attended by over 50 people, the audience was made up of friends, family, readers of my book and blog – historytheinterestingbits.com - and visitors who had called at the Castle because it was a gorgeous Saturday afternoon. And they were aged from 3 to 73! I was nervous – the last time I had done a talk was when I used to give tours at this very castle as a student. I had made plenty of notes, but in the end, I never even looked at them. The stories just flowed, from one Medieval Heroine to the next, with the children kept busy counting the number of Heroines, and the number of gruesome deaths! However, the audience was lovely. Some had travelled from as far afield as Manchester, Staffordshire and Nottinghamshire. One lady gave me flowers and another gave me a 'congratulations' card from The Swinton Book Lovers Club (from my home town). Several people had brought their copies of 'Heroines of the Medieval World' for me to sign and many more bought the book on the day – it was a pleasure to sign every single copy. I am very grateful to the staff at Conisbrough Castle, who were absolutely wonderful, welcoming guests and encouraging visitors to join the talk, and even offering discounts on Castle entry to anyone who had a copy of my book. It was a perfect day. Sharon Bennett Connolly's new book Heroines of the Medieval World is available for purchase now.

The Ritz-Carlton Pays Homage to Japan's Cultural Heart with the Opening of The Ritz-Carlton, Kyoto Japan's First Urban Resort Officially Opens Kyoto – February 7, 2014: Heralded as one of the most highly-anticipated openings of 2014 in one of the world's most culturally-rich cities, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C. and Sekisui House, Ltd., one of Japan's leading property developers, officially opened The Ritz-Carlton, Kyoto today; the city's first truly international luxury hotel and Japan's first urban resort. Located in the heart of a city famed for its Zen temples, palaces and gardens, the riverside resort brings the unsurpassed elegance and renowned service of The Ritz-Carlton to Kyoto, while honoring the cultural heritage of the city through design. "We are honoured to open our fourth Ritz-Carlton in Japan, in the beautiful city of Kyoto. Our customers are always looking to explore evocative, new and inspiring destinations and have long expressed a desire for us to offer in this incredible location" said Herve Humler, president and chief operating officer of The Ritz-Carlton.

It sits on the gentle banks of the Kamogawa River in Nijho Ohashi, close to Kyoto's popular downtown areas including Gion and Kawaramachi-dori, the city's retail and entertainment districts. The hotel's luxury guestrooms and suites offer full views of the river and the Higashiyama Mountains. The architects and designers have retained the character and aesthetic of a traditional Meiji house and courtyard into the architectural structure of the building. The interiors created by Peter Remedios and Spin Studios pay homage to the traditions of Japan, with patterned motifs created by local artisans and the incorporation of Zen rock gardens (karesansui) and water features, including a four-storey waterfall are aesthetically positioned in the heart of the hotel. The Kamogawa Suite and its sister suites with their moon deck gardens (tsukimidai) and floor to ceiling windows offer luxurious accommodations with enviable panoramic views of the river and mountains, forming an unrivalled sanctuary of luxury refinement and service.

The city and its environs is also home to almost a quarter of Japan's national treasures. While many of these visitors are Japanese, there is real growth in the numbers of international visitors coming to the city, and Kyoto is now very much must-see destination for sophisticated global travelers who are attracted to the city for its quintessential Japanese experience.
The standard length for a US resume is one to two pages. A resume that dates back too far can make an applicant look older or automatically convince the hiring manager that you will want more money than they want to pay. A resume with too many listings can make it appear as if you can't hold a job. This might cause the hiring manager to question why you move around so much. In particular, if you need to list more than two employers for a single year, it can leave a negative impression. A resume that focuses on repetitive job listings because of short-term or contract employment can lose a reader's interest and they might not take note of your significant accomplishments as a result. Even though many online job applications will request detailed dates of employment (including day, month, or both along with the year), it is best to use only years for your resume. Using only years will allow you to leave temporary employment off your resume and cover other small job gaps that would appear if you include months. It is understandable if you don't leave one job and immediately start another. A job search can take several months. Some people even use being downsized as an opportunity to spend time with family or take a vacation they couldn't go on while working. There is just no reason to advertise that you were unemployed for an extended period of time. So just go ahead and use only years for when you started and ended your employment. Sometimes a job doesn't work out. Maybe it wasn't a good fit. Perhaps the company was sold and restructured right after you were hired. Maybe you were recruited to a more ideal position just a few months after you started a new role. Or perhaps you took the role knowing it would be short-term. No matter what, if you held the job for only a few months and it doesn't add anything to your resume, go ahead and leave it off. Since you need to limit your resume to two pages and want to avoid the perception of job hoping, omitting short-term employment can help you achieve those goals. The only reason to make an exception is if you accomplished something significant at that job that can't be covered with any other role. In order to avoid the appearance of job hoping, you may want to consider grouping contract roles or freelance employment together on your resume. If you can group three or more together under a title such as "Contract Project Manager" or "Contract Business Consultant" that can save space and give the appearance that you were working in one capacity for several years instead of several months. Leveraging this strategy can be particularly useful when you have performed similar duties in multiple contract roles. That way, instead of being repetitive on your resume, you can list all those job duties under one position. Then you can list special achievements by company name. Generally speaking, hiring managers are only interested in your last 10 to 15 years of experience. If you are a senior-level manager or executive, your experience probably far exceeds that range. Still, there are times when people don't want to completely omit their earlier experience. In those cases, summarizing your work in a career note can be effective. When doing so, you can include a highlight or two, but go ahead and leave out years, using only your title and company name. Career Note: Prior experience includes Senior Finance Manager for Company X, overseeing P&L for $2M in revenue, and Senior Accountant/Consultant for Company Y and the Big 4 Firm XYZ. While the phrase "less is more" can certainly be applied to resume writing, it can also be carried too far. I've seen resumes where the person stripped out so much of their professional experience that it looked like they were a recent graduate instead of a Senior-Level Manager. A resume needs to strike the delicate balance of being brief and impactful while still giving the applicant the weight of experience the job demands. One good guide is to keep the word count to 700 - 800 words. That should allow you to make a positive impression on the reader without bogging them down in too much detail.
Tottenham Hotspur (BENNY) Filmed: May 2022 Release status: Unreleased Shown in: Twitter - Worldwide London football club, Tottenham Hotspurs (commonly referred to as just "Spurs") have a new signing from Sweden in the form of national Swedish football star, Dejan Kulusevski, who was on loan from Juventus (Italian football team). On Tuesday 10 May, Spurs' social media platforms posted this short video of British comedian Michael McIntyre singing a football chant with Benny to the tune of Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight) with the tag-line, "The duet you didn't know you needed... Michael McIntyre and ABBA's Benny Andersson". Apparently football fans have been chanting this for Dejan Kulusevski for a while with the following lyrics: Gimme, gimme, gimme a ginger from Sweden He came from Juventus, And he plays on the wing His name is Kulusevski View Benny and Michael McIntyre here on Instagram Where this was filmed and when I do not know. This whole thing confused me at first because Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal are both North London football clubs and fierce rivals. It is known that Benny is an Arsenal supporter so why would he be joining in for a Spurs player? Probably because he's Swedish and plays for the national side, but what do I know? I am Just A Girl.

More than 7,000 Kids Decide to Follow Jesus –YFC Billy Graham Archive & Research Center is Now Open 'Praise the Lord!' Ukrainian Christians Cheer Kherson Liberation JESUS Film Makes History, Now Translated in 2,000 Languages U.S. Renews Calls Against Blasphemy Laws MercyMe hopes new album can help heal divisions: 'We've got a divided body of Christ' Frustrated with Hallmark? Try Great American Family By: Joyce Dimaculangan The Youth for Christ (YFC) announced that 7,323 kids and teens made the decision to follow Jesus Christ this year. This is twice the record reported in 2021. "I know that God is going to use YFC to bring revival to today's kids," said YFC President and CEO Jake Bland. "God's Spirit is moving through leaders everywhere across the nation, The Gospel is needed and as effective as ever, especially as the unfailing love of Christ meets today's changing youth landscape." God is already uncovering His story of hope among this next generation, and I believe He's preparing to do even more. —Jake Bland, Youth for Christ president and CEO Bland said today's youth faces issues which are different in nature. For example, he pointed out that 20 years ago, the biggest issues for teens were drunk driving or teen pregnancy, but now, it's their mental health. "The U.S. Surgeon General recently declared youth mental health as a state of emergency." He added that what's disturbing is that the young are dealing with mental health problems, but one-third of them have no trusted adults in their lives. "Over 50% of youth are not connected to a church. The reality is our kids in this nation are at a vulnerable tipping point — a pivotal moment. There's a whole generation that could slip through the cracks." According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in seven 10 to 19-year-olds experiences a mental disorder. The young people are dealing with depression, anxiety and behavioral disorders that are among the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents. The report found that, globally, it is estimated that 1 in 7 (14%) 10-19 year-olds experience mental health conditions, yet these remain largely unrecognized and untreated. The agency warned that, "The consequences of failing to address adolescent mental health conditions extend to adulthood. It can impair both physical and mental health while limiting opportunities to lead fulfilling lives as adults." Despite the grim statistics, the YFC president believes that there are many ways and opportunities to give hope to these troubled teens. "I have never been more convinced that Christ is moving. Right now, we are living in the kinds of cultural conditions that God often uses for His purpose," he claimed. "Despite the challenges kids face and a culture that confuses, it's never been clearer. God is already uncovering His story of hope among this next generation, and I believe He's preparing to do even more." Bland said the number of young people who made the decision to follow Jesus in 2022 is proof that God's Spirit is working. He maintained that a deep, meaningful and sincere relationship with Jesus Christ can help today's youth during these crucial times in their lives. A recent survey of 13 to 25-year-olds backs YFC's assertion that the youth benefits from having a relationship with Jesus Christ. Dr. Josh Packard of the Springtide Research Institute said his extensive research concluded that those who pray and have a connection with God are more likely to flourish in their overall happiness and mental health, reports Vision Christian Media. "Faith and spirituality are good for you. If you're a person who believes in some kind of higher power and has a connection to that higher power, you're generally flourishing more than your peers," he said. "Those who pray more tend to be flourishing more in all areas including their mental health." The executive director of the institute concluded that it is advantageous for young people to have a connection to something bigger than themselves.

"In many ways, GE's current situation fits the profile of an ideal Warren Buffett investment," the firm's analyst writes Warren Buffett may come to the rescue of General Electric once again, according to one Wall Street firm. RBC Capital Markets analyzed whether it made sense for Buffett to invest in GE at these levels. General Electric's stock rose 4.3 percent Tuesday amid unsubstantiated speculation that the Oracle of Omaha was buying shares of the beleaguered industrial conglomerate. The company's shares have significantly underperformed the market. Its stock has declined 55 percent in the past 12 months through Tuesday versus the S&P 500's 11 percent return. "Berkshire Hathaway has a history of investing in storied businesses struggling at steep valuation dislocations. In many ways, GE's current situation fits the… Amtrak gets nearly $2 billion in federal spending bill, despite Trump criticism and accidents Amtrak gets nearly $2 billion in federal funding, rather than a steep cut that President Trump proposed, under a broad spending measure released Wednesday. Trump had proposed cutting $630 million from the national passenger railroad's federal subsidies for the year that started Oct. 1, out of $1.4 billion provided the previous year. "Amtrak's long-distance trains do not serve a vital transportation purpose and are a vestige of when train service was the only viable transcontinental transportation option," Trump's budget said. But the spending bill provides $1.3 billion for the long-distance network. The bill also provides $650 million to Amtrak for the Northeast Corridor (NEC), the popular route which runs from Washington, D.C., to Boston. "Amtrak thanks Congress for recognizing the importance of intercity passenger rail and the Northeast Corridor," Amtrak CEO Richard Anderson said. "The increased NEC capital funding will allow us to address many important needs along the corridor… City Council demands discounted MetroCards for low-income New Yorkers NY Curbed The City Council is taking matters into its own hands after Mayor de Blasio neglected to include funding for a reduced fare MetroCard program for low-income New Yorkers in the preliminary draft of the city's fiscal year 2019 budget. This marks the second year in a rowDe Blasio has bucked the proposed program. As a response, more than half of the City Council has signed a letter to Council Speaker Corey Johnson and Finance Committee Chair Daniel Dromm affirming their support for Fair Fares. The discount fare program proposed by the Community Service Society and Riders Alliance would make working-age New York residents living at or below the poverty line of $24,339 for a family of four eligible to receive half-price MetroCards. Mayor de Blasio maintains that all things relating to the MTA are the jurisdiction of the state. But that's not sitting well with the council… Questions raised over future of Hyperloop train in Maryland ABC2-NewsABC2-News A faster way of getting from Maryland to DC may involve going underground. Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and Space-X, wants to build something called a Hyperloop that would take traffic underground. The idea is the tunnel would start in Baltimore and would only take up the space of a parking spot. RELATED: Elon Musk working on bringing Hyperloop to Maryland The plans indicate there would be trailers called skates, and individual cars to hold passengers and bicyclists speeding up to 124 miles per hour underground reducing the trip to only 29 minutes. The 35-mile long tunnel would end at New York Avenue in DC. Boeing already has a permit to start digging, and they're working with more than a dozen agencies including the MDTA to get the plans off the ground. They say construction of the tunnels could take 1-2 years, but the digging would happen 30… New Development To Include Elevator Access At Broad Street Subway Station City Land Mixed-use building seeks to add two new elevators to lower Manhattan subway station.

Hyundai has revealed the first pictures of the new i40 Estate, ahead of its world premiere at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show. The debut of i40 Estate comes as Hyundai launches its new brand slogan `New Thinking. New Possibilities.' The i40 Estate reflects the spirit of change at Hyundai, and represents the company's bold new concept of `modern premium' - the philosophy that premium quality and characteristics should be accessible to everyone. The i40 Estate is the company's first D-segment vehicle to be developed specifically for the European market, with a package of powertrains, equipment and technology tailored for European tastes. It will be shown in Geneva in estate form, and this will be the first i40 Estate bodystyle to be introduced to Europe, with a saloon to follow later this year. Designed and engineered at Hyundai's R&D headquarters in Russelsheim, Germany, the i40 Estate is the latest Hyundai model to have a purely European identity. Taking styling cues from Hyundai's `fluidic sculpture' design language, it maintains signature features such as the hexagonal grille. The grille is flanked by two jewel-like headlamps, for a contemporary, confident look that is accentuated by the characterful lines that connect the front and rear of the vehicle, adding to the i40 Estate's eye-catching, sophisticated style. In line with Hyundai's commitment to make premium products and features available to everyone, the i40 Estate has a class-leading level of standard equipment. Among the specification are new technologies for Hyundai, including: heated and reclining front and rear seats; a heated steering wheel; and an active de-mist system that automatically detects and clears mist on the windscreen. The `modern premium' concept is also evident in the efficient powertrain choices available to i40 Estate buyers. The i40 Estate's 1.7-litre diesel engine, codenamed `UII', will emit from just 113 g/km of CO2 emissions - a best-in-class figure that also demonstrates the advances the company is making towards global leadership in eco-technology. Hyundai's unrivalled customer care package, Five Year Triple Care, will come as standard on i40 Estate. The industry-leading package offers total peace of mind, with a five-year unlimited-mileage warranty, five years' roadside assistance and five years of vehicle health checks. Allan Rushforth, Senior Vice President and COO of Hyundai Motor Europe, commented, "Offering more for less has always been a fundamental principle at Hyundai, and now we are advancing this with our new brand direction under the `New Thinking. New Possibilities.' slogan. The i40 Estate is a perfect example of how we are offering the best and making it accessible to everyone. From stunning design and specification, to industry-leading technology and aftersales care - the i40 Estate sets itself apart from its competitors." The i40 Estate will be joined on stage by Hyundai's ground-breaking new 1+2 door Veloster coupe, set for launch in Europe later in 2011. The Curb concept will also be shown, highlighting the latest telematics technology from Hyundai in an `urban-ready' design. Both cars received their world premieres at the North America International Auto Show last month, and will be making their European debuts in Geneva.
Osmotic stress induces biofilm production by Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates from neonates. Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the leading causes of bloodstream infections, particularly in premature neonates, and biofilm formation is a major virulence factor. We characterized biofilm formation by 50 S. epidermidis neonatal isolates under osmotic stress and evaluated the expression of biofilm-associated genes. Phenotypical analyses of biofilm production were performed in culture medium with or without addition of NaCl or glucose. In control medium (no additions), most isolates (84%) were nonproducers or weak biofilm producers. Growth in NaCl-containing medium increased the number of moderate/strong producers, and this increase was even greater in medium containing glucose. Most of the protein-enriched biofilms (60%) could be observed only during growth in glucose, whereas 50% of the polysaccharide-enriched biofilms were observed during growth in NaCl. Studies that evaluate the conditions used to characterize biofilm production are important to help us understand the dynamics of this important virulence factor in S. epidermidis and their impact on neonatal infections.

"My child is bad at sports!" TEAM sports at early tweens (ages 7 to 11) facilitates development of cognitive and psychomotor skills, says an educator and a former top athlete, a view shared by two other experts in sports education. With generally higher levels of obesity and a tendency to small families offering fewer socially appropriate interactive contexts for the early primary school child, team sports offer him/her significant health and developmentally appropriate social benefits. They get a chance to make new friends and have good fun at the same time. In this concluding installment of a story on tweens and team sports, the experts discuss how parents can provide appropriate support in helping their child to cope with likely challenges. UNLESS a family is outdoor sports-oriented, it is likely that a child gets his or her early introduction to team sports via their school CCAs. In the primary school, the common ones would be netball and football with greater participation by those in the upper primary (late tweens, ages 11-12). And since 2007, there's a new team sport CCA, floorball. Some experts may argue, based on developmental criteria, that the early to mid tweens (7-10 years) may be too soon for team sports participation. Others may disagree citing other benefits. But the existence of such team sports CCAs in our primary schools underscore the value(s) a child can acquire if the participation is under proper guidance. Former athletes (individual and team sports) and educators provide their perspectives in this two-part article.

NC towns turn to bow hunting to control deer Posted on October 22, 2013 by southernipmcenter A growing number of communities around Charlotte are turning to bow hunters to thin the herds of deer that cause thousands of vehicle collisions a year. After decades of restoration, white-tailed deer have rebounded from a low of 10,000 statewide in 1900 to the estimated 1.1 million today. Their population growth has leveled off in many parts of the state – except in cities and suburbs, where hunting is typically banned and deer are spreading. Lovely to look at, deer are also prolific breeders, happy devourers of home landscaping, and they figured in 90 percent of the 20,181 animal-car collisions reported in North Carolina last year. The answer, dozens of communities have decided in recent years, is in judicious use of the bow and arrow. The silent, short-range weapons are safer within city limits than firearms but just as lethal to their targets. The foothills town of Elkin, in 2007, became the first to adopt an urban archery season authorized by the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission. For this coming season, Jan. 11 to Feb. 15, 44 towns and cities will allow bow hunting for deer. Among the latest additions is Huntersville, the only Mecklenburg County community to adopt the hunting season. Concord, Harrisburg, Indian Trail, Kannapolis, Troutman and Weddington are among the towns already enrolled. "One of the primary drivers for us is public safety, being suburban and with lots of open areas with high concentrations of deer," said Huntersville town manager Greg Ferguson. "We've had a number of deer-auto crashes, and some of those at high speeds." Mecklenburg County ranked 10th-highest statewide with 1,345 animal-vehicle collisions between 2010 and 2012, the N.C. Department of Transportation reports. Unlike some towns, Huntersville already allows bow hunting during the statewide deer season, which runs from early September through December. Ferguson said the town has heard no opposition to the add-on archery season. Troutman, on the northern end of Lake Norman and surrounded by woods, was also plagued by deer-car accidents. Three years after adding an archery season, police Chief Matthew Selves said, "I can just tell you we have less traffic accidents." Statewide, urban bow hunters killed 82 deer earlier this year, more than half of them does. The harvest by guns and other weapons took more than 167,000. If you wish to be a part of this, I would recommend you look at these upper parts for AR-15's and use them to get the max out of every shot you fire. "It's not so much the number of deer taken from a community, it's just reintroducing a predator – and that's the hunter," said Ramon Bell, past president of the 1,000-member N.C. Bowhunters Association. "That area that has become a sanctuary for deer no longer is." The bow hunters group offers certified, insured hunters to cull deer on private land, including gated communities and Duke University's research forest. Only one town has signed on, Bell said. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals calls bowhunting to control deer populations cruel and ineffective. "It's not new and it doesn't work," said campaign specialist Ashley Byrne in New York. "Bowhunting is one of the cruelest forms of hunting." She said hunters sometimes trail their bleeding prey for hours. PETA argues that killing deer only leaves a void that others soon fill, and that communities wouldn't continue to offer the hunts if they worked. The group advises nonlethal methods of deer control, such as using repellants around landscaping. The Mecklenburg County parks department allows controlled deer hunts in the Latta Plantation, Cowans Ford and McDowell nature preserves to thin herds that over-graze native plants and can carry diseases. The hunts, in which only muzzle-loading rifles and shotguns are allowed because of their limited firing ranges, result in about 60 to 70 deer a year. The marquee urban-archery town is Elkin, 70 miles north of Charlotte. The rural town on the Yadkin River is surrounded by rolling forests. "We're blessed with deer, or cursed by them, you might say, depending on when the last time you hit a deer," said town manager Lloyd Payne. So many night-patrolling police cars collided with the animals that the town's insurance company urged Elkin to do something. Some residents didn't like the idea. At a town forum, they worried about the sight of wounded deer bounding through backyards. That hasn't happened, Payne said, but like most towns Elkin has placed strict limits on its archery. Hunting is allowed only on private land and with the owner's permission. Elkin's bow hunters took 45 deer in 2008 and have led the state for each urban archery season since then. Deer numbers appear to be down, Payne said, as are patrol car collisions. Tim Gestwicki, chief executive of the N.C. Wildlife Federation in Charlotte, called urban archery "a sign of the times that more and more municipalities will opt in as a management tool." The federation last month named Elkin its Municipal Conservationist of the Year.

Nikki Haley: Mass murderer Dylann Roof 'hijacked' meaning of Confederate flag The former Trump U.N. ambassador was S.C. governor when the state removed the divisive symbol from the statehouse after the mass slaughter of African American parishioners in 2015. Nikki Haley says the Confederate flag represented 'service' and 'sacrifice' until racist shooter Dylann Roof 'hijacked' it In an interview with Blaze TV's Glenn Beck , former US Ambassador to the UN and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said white supremacist gunman Dylann Roof "hijacked" the meaning of the Confederate flag. On June 17, 2015 Roof opened fire in a Wednesday night Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine people and injuring three others. Haley said that Roof, who published a racist manifesto invoking the Confederate flag, "hijacked everything that people thought of" about the flag's meaning, saying, "people saw it as service, and sacrifice...

You love classic cars but you know that they come with a price and particular upkeep that you might not be able to maintain on your own. Whenever you see a beautiful old Chevy or Mustang pass you by, you might wonder when you'll ever have your dream vehicle or if it's simply a dream that is getting away from you. Luckily, there is an item known as a replica car kit that will build you the muscle car of your dreams if you have made this your ongoing hobby. Some might say that these car kits are 'not as good as the originals,' but this is far from the truth. If you believe that a replica car kit is just as good as the real thing, making any vehicle into a beauty without the care of an old vehicle, there are many kits available for you on the market. One of the most popular is the Shelby Cobra kit, with many people feeling nostalgic about this beautiful vehicle that stormed the country. For many, one of these car kits is just what they need to get the feel of a Cobra and the speed that they desired. With racing becoming more and more popular on raceways, people are choosing these kits for their vehicle dreams. Some of these vehicles, which are primarily used for racing, can weigh up to 3,400 pounds but Cobras and other small vehicles are known for weighing less. Cobras have been popular since the 60s. In fact, Carroll Shelby built 654 small-blcok Cobras and big block versions from the early 60s into 1968. In one race, a Cobra reached up to 186 mph, making it one of the fastest race cars of its time. This is why, today, Cobras have become extremely popular in the racing and show worlds. If you believe that a Cobra is right for you but you desire a new vehicle, a replica Cobra car kit might be just the option that you need so that you can maintain the vehicle of your dreams. Get started on the vehicle of your dreams and invest in your kit today! This entry was posted in Best kit cars for beginners, Cobra replica, Shelby cobra kit car. Bookmark the permalink.
Beck's Basic Moves By Brad Gruetzmacher - Mighty No. 9 has had a busy couple of weeks. After the announcement of a new animated series in the works, the team at comcept have decided to get back to the basics and reveal more about the main character Beck. In our last update we were treated to some information about Beck's sidekick Call and her character animations. Now we learn more information about the main hero Beck and some of his basic moves. The first video being shared shows off Beck's basic actions of running/jumping/shooting. As fans of platformers know, each game takes a different approach to jump mechanics and running. LittleBigPlanet's floaty jumps in despised by some and loved by others, while Mario has a much tighter control. It would appear that Beck runs with a much looser style, but you can judge for yourself in this newly released video. In the second video we are treated to seeing Beck and his climbing abilities. This includes both going up and down ladders, but also dangling from ledges. It gives a good idea as to how Beck will shoot while traversing both up and down. Video three shows off Beck's dash attack, which is an ability that we've learned Call will not have. The dash will not only be useful for attacks, but also to gain access to tight spaces. And finally we get a look at Beck's "absorb" ability. Once Beck has worn down an enemy sufficiently enough, he can dash into them in order to absorb their "Xel" which can then be converted into power-ups. This is an ability that is unique to Beck "and it's this ability he has to use in order to save everybody." As each video warns though, this is a work in progress so the final game may not turn out exactly as these videos portray.

Q: Why does +!{}[true] output 1 in javascript I was watching this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Trr95ij1358 And Mr Baranovskiy emphasizes that javascript developers should know what this evaluates to: +!{}[true] So I gave it a shot.

When arrested May 11, Turner was a science special education teacher at Hilsman Middle School, according to Mary Walsh Wickwire, spokesperson for the Clarke County School District. Quinnesha Sha'Tara Turner The indictment alleges that Turner had sexual relations with the student at Turner's home in Watkinsville. The student's gender was not noted in the indictment an Athens-Clarke County police did not release the gender and other details of the case. The indictment only identifies the student as being under 16 years old. Turner's defense attorney Ryan Swingle declined to comment about the accusations against his client. "Que Turner is a solid person, athlete and citizen," Swingle said on Tuesday. "She's worked incredibly hard throughout her athletic and academic career," Swingle said. "She would never intentionally hurt a child." The attorney said that as a student, Turner was a standout athlete at Cedar Shoals High School who went on to play basketball for Brenau University where she had a full-ride scholarship. Following her arrest, Turner was released from the Clarke County Jail upon posting a $38,700 property bond, according to court records. She is scheduled to be arraigned June 19.

Q: What are these PCB calibration standards? I found these shunt resistors in a paper that uses them to calibrate AC equipment for EIS testing. They used the "frequency dependent complex impedance response" of these standards to calculate the error coefficients. I'm interested in implementing the same method myself but am having trouble finding these. I tried looking up PCB calibration standard, PCB shunt resistor but couldn't find anything with known inductive properties. Not sure if these are custom PCBs or if they are commercially available and would really appreciate it if someone could point me to where I can find/make some of these. A: The term "standard" is not the thing that you first thought of, such as IEC-... or EN-... . Yes, sounds confusing. A standard is basically a reference for error-corrected measurements and measurement devices. All of its useful properties (complex impedance, delay, thermal-related, loss factor, etc.) are known and don't change from measurement to measurement. So it can be used as a reference. A standard can be a SHORT (Zero Ohms), OPEN (Infinite Ohms), LOAD, etc. But in practice we know that nothing can be exactly zero Ohms, or infinite Ohms (because we don't know what number is) or 10.0000000000000000000000000000000000....00 milliohms. So, the standards are created to have parameters which are "constant" and "close enough to desired value", just to define the zero, max, and error of a measurement and/or a device i.e. to say, for example, "0.003 milliohms is my zero". Hence the name standard.
Anya Taylor-Joy, who plays Casey Cooke, runs towards safety in a scene from the movie, "Split." Photo courtesy of Universal Pictures. M. Night Shyamalan is a controversial name amongst the film community. He has been praised for his early films like the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, but people nowadays mostly think of his more recent work like The Last Airbender, The Happening, and After Earth. His recent streak of bad films has made Shyamalan more of a punch line than anything else, but I am glad to say that his new film, Split, breaks this trend. Split is about three teenage girls who get kidnapped by a strange man named Kevin, played by James McAvoy. As the film goes on, the girls discover that Kevin suffers from split personality disorder, each of which have different emotions and memories. The girls must find a way to escape before the "beast" comes for them. The concept of Split could have easily come off as cartoony, but it comes off as very tense and nerve racking thanks to a masterful performance by McAvoy. In my opinion, this is the best acting I have seen from McAvoy, who has been great in the X-Men films as Professor Xavier. He really shows his range in this film transforming into each of the different personalities, but what really impressed me was McAvoy's physical performance. For each personality, he would have a different posture and way of walking and I found that fascinating. Anya Taylor-Joy who took the role of the main girl Casey was also great. Her character had a troubled past, as seen through flashbacks, which allowed Joy to show off her range as an actress through many emotional scenes throughout the film. Shyamalan's directing shines in this film. He does a great job creating this creepy world the audience experiences. The way the shots are arranged with various sounds really creates a tense and uncomfortable environment for the audience. This is a Shyamalan film, which means there must be a twist, and the twist works. It helps make some of the unbelievable aspects of the film have some sense to it. If you are familiar with Shyamalan's previous work, you will get a nice kick out of the ending. Split is a return to form for Shyamalan. The film hooks its audience with incredible performances and great direction by Shyamalan. This is a film that is absolutely worth checking out in the theater.

Specifically, this research aims to assess the tourism potential of holy Hindu temple sites located along well-known pilgrimage routes. During our fieldwork, we visited several of the most significant Hindu temples in India. Framed by a critical ethnography lens, our study used unstructured interviews with local stakeholders, as well as observations and reflexive notes. The findings revealed that most of the temples have serious safety, hygiene, accessibility, and environmental issues. A lack of action could lead to serious consequences for locals and tourists. For example, important for tourism, warnings of pandemics have been sounded over the years, and disease pandemics originating in India may only be a matter of time. We propose some immediate solutions and areas for future research.

This loss is estimated to be $50 million net of reinsurance including reinsurance reinstatement costs, $32.5 million after tax, and will reduce third quarter earnings of the company by approximately $0.30 per diluted share. Stephen L. Way, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Our exposure is predominantly to energy and large commercial property accounts and is substantially protected by catastrophe reinsurance." Way added, "From an industry standpoint, premium rates will need to rise significantly in these lines of business to reflect both the increased frequency and severity of catastrophic events that have occurred over the past five years."

Some human favorites, such as roses, camellias, petunias, and begonias, may draw bees but are typically ignored by butterflies. Since we've been asked a lot over the years, we've have complied a list of Top Ten Native Perennials for Butterflies, however that list is only part of the answer. There are also annuals that attract butterflies. Consider cosmos, marigolds, pentas, and zinnias when planning a butterfly-friendly flowerbed. A Monarch taking a nectar break on it's host plant, Milkweed. Whether planting native plants, perennials, or organic plants, understand that butterflies are seeking two types of plants; nectar plants for adults to feed on, and host plants for their offspring (caterpillars) to feed on. A butterfly garden that contains both nectar and host plants will draw more butterflies because they're more likely to lay their eggs on the host plants. Butterflies are very selective when it comes to host plants and most species will only lay their eggs on one type of plant. Monarch and Queen butterflies only lay eggs on types of milkweed. (Ask our staff about tropical milkweed, an easy growing, re-seeding annual.) Gulf and Variegated Fritillary caterpillars feed on passion vine, while caterpillars of the Pipevine Swallowtail prefer pipevine, and Black Swallowtails prefer the herbs dill, fennel, or rue. Thus, while you can feed nearly all species of adult butterflies with nectar plants such as penta, coneflower, aster, yarrow, and others, you'll need specific host plants to attract specific species. Otherwise, the adults may stop for a bit of nectar, but won't stay long enough to lay eggs. To find out what host plants are preferred by which species, visit the North American Butterfly Association and check out their Regional Butterfly Guides. Click on the map for the Dallas-Fort Worth Guide then come to Shades of Green and let us help you find the plants you need to attract the butterflies you want.

In our automated and connected economy, data has become the coin of the realm. Companies need it to market to their customers, to develop their products, to come to corporate decisions, to build and test their own apps. It is ubiquitous — or so it would seem. In truth, the right dataset can be as valuable as any hard asset that a company might own. "As much as we all feel inundated with information overload, ask any machine learning researcher and they will tell you that there isn't enough data to learn," said Mansi Singhal CEO of qplum. Essentially a company has three choices: it can build it, like IFI CLAIMS did, it can buy it, or it can do a little of both. Whatever the company decides, Singhal said, it will not be cheap. "This is something that many other firms are facing as the big hurdle — how to create large datasets economically so that models can be trained and answers can be more accurate and high quality," she said. But there is more than just cost to consider. Indeed a company has to weigh several — sometimes competing — factors as it makes a decision about the data it will use. It's rarely a pure IT decision — i.e. choosing the most comprehensive dataset available. "It's always a game of maximizing value," said Natalie Robb, founder of Wavelength Analytics. "Like anything else, determining which dataset is best is based on trade-offs," she said. Meaning the "best" dataset is one that fits the budget, meets the project's data quantity and quality needs and time constraints. "Let's say you want to know consumer sentiment," Robb said. "Amazon and eBay make customer review data available — and nothing is more comprehensive than Amazon's customer reviews." But, she continued, the dataset is enormous, which means you need to have the requisite machine learning and natural language processing tools and skills. Ultimately, the question is not so much where to get the data, but which kind of dataset could support your business, said Majken Sander, business analyst and solution architect with TimeXtender. "No matter your goal, there's a dataset out there to support you." As companies dive into this process, here are some arguments for each possibility. Built a contact database of more than 30,000 records within a month from business cards collected by sales reps over the years for a B2B software organization. Constructed a database of 800,000 consumers over a 6-month period by digitizing manually written warranty cards for a reputed company in consumer electronics. "A small home maintenance organization with minimum automation started to scan the 2,000 service reports to create their own CRM database within a week," Sharma said. But the most valuable data a company has is undoubtedly what it knows about its existing customers and prospects, said Nick Worth, CMO at Selligent Marketing Cloud. "Deepening that understanding with a powerful marketing platform and augmenting that critical first-party data with external sources is the right place to start to both deepen existing customer relationships and develop look-a-like models for acquiring more customers," he said. There are a number of sources from where companies can buy data, Robb said. There are aggregators such as Lotame, Gravy Analtyics or Foursquare. There are enterprise data sources such as Hoovers, DiscoverOrg, ZoomInfo and Lead 411. A company can get enterprise buyer intent data from companies such as Bombora or 6Sense. Finally a company can buy another organization's first party data from marketplaces or exchanges, Robb said. The best options for building datasets are connecting and blending public and private, said Christopher Penn, co-founder of Brain+Trust Insights. For example, he said, a healthcare company will have its own proprietary data, but it may not be rich in depth. This company could go to Medicare or other government websites and append additional relevant data to its dataset to beef it up for statistical analysis, data science, machine learning and AI. Last year, Penn did a test with the AHRQ Medicare Hospital Quality Dataset, which he said had some serious gaps in it. "I blended it with the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census Bureau data to enrich the AHRQ dataset and 'complete' it with imputation," he said.

Q: Why is a slice category a category? I don't understand why the Hom-sets in a slice category are disjoint. Let $C$ be a category and $A$ an object of $C$, then the slice category $C_{A}$ has as objects all morphisms $f\colon Z \to A $ where $Z$ is an object of $C$. For two objects of $C_A$, $f_1 \colon Z_1 \to A$ and $f_2 \colon Z_2 \to A$, the elements of $Hom_{C_A}(f_1,f_2)$ are given by the elements of $\sigma \in Hom_{C}(Z_1,Z_2)$ that satisfy $f_1=f_2 \circ \sigma$. The definition of a category entails that $Hom_{C_A}(f,g)$ and $Hom_{C_A}(f',g')$ have to be disjoint unless $(f,g)=(f',g')$. Now let $Z$ be an object in $C$ and let $f_1,f_2 \in Hom_{C}(Z,A)$ such that $f_1 \neq f_2$ Then the identity morphism $id_Z \in Hom_C(Z,Z)$ satisfies $f_1=f_1\circ id_Z$ and $f_2=f_2\circ id_Z$. Hence $id_Z \in Hom_{C_A}(f_1,f_1)$ and $id_Z \in Hom_{C_A}(f_2,f_2)$, implying that $C_A$ is not a category. What am i getting wrong here? I've had this problem since i read the definition of a slice category in Aluffi's book, which i find a bit unclear. At first i thought that maybe the morphisms contain the information of their source and target and that instead of elements in $Hom_C(f_1,f_2)$ they would be something like tuples of the form $(f_1,f_2,\sigma)$ where $\sigma \in Hom_C(f_1,f_2)$. But according to the definition given on Wikipedia for example (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_category#Definition), this doesn't seem to be the case. A: There are two ways you can define the morphism part of a category $\mathcal{C}$. Either: * *Define a set $\mathrm{mor}(\mathcal{C})$ of morphisms and functions $\mathrm{dom}, \mathrm{cod} : \mathrm{mor}(\mathcal{C}) \to \mathrm{ob}(\mathcal{C})$; or *Define sets $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)$ for each $A,B \in \mathrm{ob}(\mathcal{C})$. To translate from the first definition into the second, you can define $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)$ to be $\{ f \in \mathrm{mor}(\mathcal{C}) \mid \mathrm{dom}(f) = A \text{ and } \mathrm{cod}(f) = B \}$. Then the hom sets are automatically disjoint since the domain and codomain are encoded in the morphism. In the second case, however, the hom sets don't need to be disjoint, since we haven't explicitly required disjointness of the hom sets. Thus the second case is more general than the first case. This is why some people require hom sets to be disjoint—namely, so that $\mathrm{dom}(f)$ and $\mathrm{cod}(f)$ are well-defined. However, you can always turn a specification of a category without disjoint hom sets into a specification of a category with disjoint hom sets, by replacing $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)$ by $\{A\} \times \{ B \} \times \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)$, so that a morphism $f : A \to B$ is then 'officially' a triple $(A,B,f)$. This is equivalent to defining $\mathrm{mor}(\mathcal{C})$ to be the disjoint union $\bigsqcup\limits_{(A,B) \in \mathrm{ob}(\mathcal{C}) \times \mathrm{ob}(\mathcal{C})} \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)$ and taking $\mathrm{dom}$ and $\mathrm{cod}$ to be the respective projection maps to $\mathrm{ob}(\mathcal{C})$. Under this encoding, a morphism $\sigma : (f_1 : Z_1 \to A) \to (f_2 : Z_2 \to A)$ in $\mathcal{C}/A$ is 'officially' a triple $(f_1,f_2,\sigma)$ where $\sigma : Z_1 \to Z_2$ and $f_2 \circ \sigma = f_1$. The morphisms $\mathrm{id}_Z : f_1 \to f_1$ and $\mathrm{id}_Z : f_2 \to f_2$ are then 'officially' triples $(f_1,f_1,\mathrm{id}_Z)$ and $(f_2,f_2,\mathrm{id}_Z)$, so you don't have any issues. However, in practice, it's easier to define $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)$ without worrying about whether the hom sets are disjoint, and rest easy with the knowledge that the hom sets could be made disjoint if you wanted them to be.
Should straights stay out of gay bars, and gay men stay out of lesbian bars? A group of some 30 activists gathered at My Sisters' Room on Feb. 28 to air their frustrations about what they wish to see happening in Atlanta's gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community. Organized by MSR owners and wife-wife team Susan Musselwhite and Patryce Yeiser along with party promoter and singer Barry Brandon, the forum's topics included racism and segregation, transgender people being left out, and the need for LGBT groups to collaborate with other groups at all times — not just when something is needed. "I've been involved in Atlanta's LGBT community a long time and what I see is we are resource rich and collaboration poor," said Imani Evans, founder and executive director of Women Healing Women, a nonprofit that provides services to survivors of domestic and sexual abuse.
Our Finzels Reach apartments are located in Bristol in the charming district called Redcliffe which is wonderfully central, but quiet and peaceful at the same time. Across the river you will find Castle Park as well as the main Bristol shopping district. You also have direct access to the river and all the main tourist attractions, such as M-Shed and the Matthew of Bristol, and of course a host of places to eat and drink! Redcliffe gets its name from the red sandstone cliffs at Redcliffe Wharf which are a 10 minute walk, or a couple of ferry stops from the apartments. The cliffs are not very tall, but are contain a system of caves and tunnels known as the Redcliffe Caves. Over the years these caves have been used as storage areas, whilst the sand was extracted to make glass. You can still see some remnants of the glass making industry at the Kiln Restaurant. Sadly the caves are not open to the public. Bristol harbour is sometimes called the Floating Harbour as it was constructed so the main harbour area is not affected by the tide. The whole harbour front has seen a huge regeneration project with the construction of Pero's footbridge and the regeneration of buildings and warehouses in the area. Finzels Reach is on the south side of the Bristol Floating Harbour and was once a sugar refinery, a brewery and part of the site was a Tramway power generation station. The main Bristol shopping quarter is less than 10 minutes' walk from Finzels Reach over Castle Bridge, Bristol's newest bridge. This 91 meter pedestrian bridge, which opened in 2017, provides a wonderful new access right from the Finzels Reach apartments to Castle Park, where in just a short walk you have access to Cabot Circus and the main Bristol Shopping district. Directly across the river from Finzels Reach you will find Castle Park. The park is a lovely green space in the centre of Bristol and is sometimes called Castle Green because of the open green space it provides the city. The park is dominated by the ruined St Peters Church which was bombed during World War II and has been preserved as a ruin as a memorial. You will also find the remains of Bristol Castle, a Norman Castle mentioned in the Doomsday Book and built for the defense of Bristol. Castle Park is a lovely tranquil place to visit, and provides a welcome retreat from the hustle and bustle of the nearby Bristol city centre.

Let's now discuss impairment of assets and the related measurement issues. In other words, what if something happens that reduces the future benefits of asset. our external investors and creditors know it's now really reduced value. Normal cost allocation assumes no reduction of these benefits or service potential. Here are some examples of when you have reduced benefits. For example after the 9/11 terror attack in New York City. American Airlines had to write down the value of all its aircraft. 9/11 nobody wanted to get on their plane for a number of months. that asset on their balance sheet was drastically reduced. comes and destroys your assets in your operation. in Hershey we had a severe flood event that occurred in the fall of 2011. zero and try and submit insurance claim for the difference. There are different impairment tests depending on the type of assets. First of all you have impairment of PP&E finite-life intangibles. When you test for impairment. the book value of the asset may not be recovered in the future. How do you measure this impairment? Well it's a two step process. is the undiscounted future cash flows or FCF less than the book value of the asset? then stop right there there's no impairment you're in great shape. then an impairment has occurred and you must move on to the second step. the dollar amount of the loss. our balance sheet today minus the asset fair value. Please note the following in this measurement process. determine if an impairment loss has occurred back in step number one we just spoke about. they determine our amount of impairment loss which we determined in step two previously. Next, let's talk about impairment of PP&E and finite-life intangible assets. the lower book value now becomes the new cost basis for a future reduced expense. becoming a bit impaired over this confusing topic. Let's now head over to the whiteboard to review an example together. Today let's talk about impairment example. There's a lot of numbers thrown at us here so it's sift through these. We have the cost of the factory which is the historical cost that $250 million. The book value today is $180 million after depreciation we've had this far. the future value in today's value is $120 million. As we've talked about impairment testing it's a two step process. the undiscounted future cash flows being compared to the book value. 170 million is actually less than the book value of $180 million. that simply tells us that yes we do have an impairment issue. Right. So that's the first step only. the $180 million versus the fair value of 120. That difference is actually a $60 million dollar impairment loss. the two step process the first step just tells you yes or no, you have impairment. If the answer is yes you move on to step two and determine the amount of the loss. you stop right there because there's no impairment at all that has to be recognized. a $60 million significant impairment loss to recognize in our year in financials. that concept of the testing that has to offer for goodwill impairment. indefinite-life intangible assets excluding goodwill. When to test for impairment? events or changing circumstances have occurred in our company. How do you measure? Well this one's a little bit easier it's just a one step process. The impairment loss is now equal to the book value minus the fair value. because the future cash flows are presumed to continue indefinitely. And finally, let's talk about impairment of goodwill. or more frequently when the events are changed and the circumstances have occurred. The key here is you test to that the reporting unit or segment level of the company. making what they call qualitative evaluations. It's not numerical in nature. defined as greater than 50 percent probability that the asset is impaired. This is per 2011 accounting standard update or ASU. Next we talk about how do we measure this impairment. Well, we're back to the two step process we talked about earlier. is the reporting fair value less than its book value. No. Then stop, you have no impairment to record. If it's yes, then impairment has occurred and you have to move on to the second step. Here in the second step are impairment loss. Under this situation is the book value minus a term called Implied Fair Value. OK. I know what you're thinking. What is this implied fair value? which are assets minus liabilities. In other words, it's as if you're recalculating goodwill using today's purchase price. Note that unlike in prior impairment testing. The value of the goodwill is not associated with any cash flows. So here's our final thoughts. lower net income in the current year and thus higher net income in the future. of other estimates that we do such as bad debt expense or warranty expense. to "manipulate" their future improved earnings. rather common when there's a change in senior management. For example a new CEO. Let me describe that. they really want to start working with a very clean balance sheet. in the past and clean them up going forward.
Medical Imaging is a technique aimed to develop tools to improve medical diagnosis and procedures. Medical imaging applications use different types of signals to create images of the inside of the human body. It is a very important technique that decreases the complication rate during procedures and provides with more information for more accurate diagnosis. One characteristic of image processing algorithms is that there are large data sets to be processed in order to provide visualization. In consequence, some diagnose imaging techniques take too long before their results are ready and the doctor can interpret them. A different approach can be used to decrease the time consumed by medical imaging algorithms. In this thesis, it has been explored the possibility of using Graphic Unit Processors (GPUs) for implementing real time medical imaging applications, more specifically ultrasound imaging for catheter ablation. The reader can find in the report the analysis of a set of medical imaging algorithms and its implementation on a GPU. There is a comparison with a CPU implementation and conclusions about the benefits and implications of developing a medical imaging application on top of a GPU.
Before and after shots are a very important part of your weight loss journey. You will be so glad that you documented your weight loss via pictures. Plus, this is one of the mandatory steps needed to be able to get on my Zuleana Weight Loss Underground Train. You don't need a Canon EOS M5 to take decent before and afters shots, you can use your camera phone, just make sure the lens is clean! You don't know how many blurry "before" pictures I have received because of a simple, dirty lens. SMH! Make sure the t-shirt is very fitted and a solid color–no patterns or logos! Note: This picture is an "AFTER" picture where she has lost 20 pounds in 8 weeks with Zuleana! Relax your hands and arms by your upper legs, please do not hold your hands behind your back! Make sure you take a picture from the front, side, and back. Try to take new pictures every time you lose weight about 12-15 pounds, then again around 18-22pounds, and again at 27-31 pounds! Almost every one of my Zuleana Girls say that they did not realize how much weight they had lost until they saw how much smaller they were in their Before and After pictures. So your before and after picture is a great motivation tool. Note: Every Zuleana Girl must present her "before" picture to Coach Cee Cee before she is able to board the underground accountability train. Also, every Zuleana Girl must take a picture with her Zuleana Box. Hold it up by your pretty face and smile! These two pictures are what you will posts to introduce yourself once you have been invited onto the train. From there, every post will be pictures of your daily Zuleana meals and workouts.

Report: Kobe Bryant will return next season Comments Off on Report: Kobe Bryant will return next season Kobe Bryant might be out for the season but he isn't ready to call it quits just yet. The Lakers confirmed on Monday that Bryant will undergo surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff in his shoulder, likely sidelining him for the remainder of the 2014-2015 campaign. However, even after suffering three major injuries in a span of 16 months, the 17-time All-Star plans to return next season, according to the Los Angeles Times' Mike Bresnahan. MORE: Kobe to have surgery | Future Laker Stanley Johnson? | Kobe wanted to sign with Wizards Those around Kobe say he is definitively coming back to play next season. Doesn't want to go out like this. — Mike Bresnahan (@Mike_Bresnahan) January 26, 2015 Bryant has fought through a number of injuries during his career and has been adament on leaving the game on his own terms. Attempting a comeback from his latest setback comes as no surprise. To sweeten the deal, Bryant is set to be the highest paid player in the NBA next season, making $25 million. In 35 games this season, Bryant averaged 22.3 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.6 assists. At 12-and-33, the Lakers hold the fourth worst record in the NBA. Without Bryant in the fold, the Lakers' chance of landing a top pick in the draft are even greater.
The chain of events that led to their march in the capital are subject of several thesis. Some say that they entered the city at the end of the 90's (the Parco della Caffarella is supposed to be the spot where they first settled). The theory is that a few examples of parrots were supposed to be sold as domestic pets back then. But some of them ran away or maybe they were set free by the same people who requested them but no longer wanted the exotic company. So the main theory is that once the exotic trend of keeping a parrot at home ran out of gas, these same parrots were left wandering around the neighborhoods of Rome. Besides the origins of this invasion, all we can say is that the parrots once they got here adjusted very well to Rome's climate and overtime have managed to survive and thrive. Estimates say that about thousands of parakeets roam in Rome in the area of Villa Borghese, Villa Ada, Parco della Caffarella and the other green hubs of the capital. Rome's climate has been turning more and more into a "tropical" climate (aside from the rare snow falls) and the parrots for sure have appreciated this warm weather. Many romans and tourists alike have embraced the colorful presence of the parrots. As far as consequences in terms of biodiversity, the experts are split. Some believe that the parrots don't damage the system and do not enter in any sort of competition with other species. Others instead claim that the presence of the parrots poses a threat to other birds such as woodpeckets, hoopoes and the popular seagulls of Rome. The reason would be that the parrots would "wage" a war for space where they would build their nest. Another reason would be the strong competition for food hunting. In any event, the massive presence of the green bird might cause repercussions on the ecosystem.in the long term. At this point though all we can do is appreciate their beauty and the fact that they make our city more colourful.

Q: Unable to open fstream when specifying an absolute path I know this is rather laughable, but I can't seem to get simple C++ ofstream code to work. Can you please tell me what could possibly be wrong with the following code: #include <fstream> ... ofstream File("C:\temp.txt"); if(File) File << "lolwtf"; Opening the ofstream fails whenever I specify an absolute path. Relative paths seems to work with no issues. I'm really uncertain as to what the issue is here. A: The problem is in your string, you are not escaping the backslash. ofstream File("C:\\temp.txt"); A: Even though Windows people seem to prefer the non-standard '\' character as a path separator, the standard '/' works perfectly and avoids annoying problems like this. So, my advice is to stick to forward slashes... std::ofstream File("C:/temp.txt"); A: Your path is invalid: "C:\temp.txt" The \ is escaping the "t" as a horizontal tab character, so the path value ends up as: "C: emp.txt" What you want is: "C:\\temp.txt" or "C:/temp.txt"

They sold parents on the premise that public education is "free." In reality, it has been very costly, not only in monetary value but in ideological devaluation. Mike Huckabee does not seem to understand this. "[F]ormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) called on conservatives to 'stop the fight' over the Common Core standards and, instead, consider the positive effects the nationalized standards might have on students in poor-performing schools." Trending: Scientists May Have Accidentally Found Cure For Cancer Every school my wife and I have taught in (including homeschooling and classical schools) has had standards from pre-school to senior high. Every school has standards. There didn't seem to be a problem with learning when I was going to school. Each year there were courses that had to be taken and expectations that had to be met. It's not rocket science. The problem isn't with the standards; it's with the content of the curriculum, the goals of those in control of education, the competency of the teachers, and the motivation of the students. You can have the best set of standards the world has ever seen and yet there still be unmotivated students and disinterested parents. Watch the 1988 film Stand and Deliver if you want to get an idea of low versus high educational expectations. The Marva Collins Story is another one. It's the movie that the teacher unions love to hate. Poor-performing schools aren't the result of the curriculum. It's more about expectations, motivation, the demand for excellence, and why an education is necessary. The education establishment today is more concerned about pushing a certain leftist ideology. The goal is control. Consider this from an interview with Ralph Peters: "I would say a crucial problem is that the conservatives over the last two to three generations turned the education system over to the Left. I mean, people self-segregate, conservatives self-segregated in the business world or the military, and the Left has self-segregated in education, and the result was changes in the curriculum that essentially took history and civics out, except for the most vanilla version of things. You may not like it, but Robert E. Lee had a greater influence on American history than Sojourner Truth did. There's just no way of getting around it, but our children are much more apt to be taught about an idealized Sojourner Truth than about Robert E. Lee, or Ulysses S. Grant, or Andrew Jackson, or Teddy Roosevelt. The result is that there are today Ivy League-educated young Americans who have no sense of our history, let alone world history. "Also in the interest of protecting our children, we've dumbed down children's literature. When I was growing up in the United States, you could buy history books specifically for kids. If I were citing the ten most influential books in my entire life, right behind the Bible – not as a religious text, but as a guide to human behavior, by the way – right behind the Bible would come The Golden Book of World History which I got when I was about six years old. It was amazingly sophisticated, with brilliant artwork. There was a series called the Landmark Books, actually, by Random House, which were by serious writers like William L. Shirer of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich fame, but simplified for pre-adolescents. "The Landmark series was brilliant. But it too has gone. By the time I got to 6th and 7th grade, I'd read about the Cossacks, the Battle of Britain, the battle of Midway, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, and many other global struggles. You go into a children's bookstore today, or the children's section of a bookstore, and there's nothing like that. So our educational system has, I'm mixing metaphors wildly here, force-fed us historical amnesia. And when you do not know your own history, let alone world history, you are prey to demagogues." How many of you remember when Stanford dropped its Western Civilization course "just months after the Reverend Jesse Jackson came on campus and led members of the Black Student Union in chants of 'Hey-hey, ho-ho, Western Civ has got to go.' More recently, faculty at the University of Texas condemned 'Western civilization' courses as inherently right wing, and Yale even returned a $20 million contribution rather than reinstate the course." (Rodney Stark, How the West Won: The Neglected Story of the Triumph of Modernity (Wilmington, DE: Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 2014), 1.)) Civilizations abhor a vacuum. While Western Civilization is not perfect, it's what made the United States the beacon to the world. The leftists want to throw out the baby with the bath water.

Cespedes will not take any live at-bats until Tuesday after experiencing right quad soreness Matt Ehalt, Staff Writer, @MattEhalt PITTSBURGH -- Yoenis Cespedes suffered a setback with the slugger experiencing soreness in his right quad while running the bases Friday night for Class A St. Lucie. Cespedes will not take any live at-bats until at least Tuesday, and he will remain at the team's complex in Port St. Lucie until he's cleared to play, according to the team. "He's day-to-day," according to Mets senior director of baseball operations Adam Fisher. "He's going to need to test it Tuesday and we'll see how serious it is then." Prior to Saturday's game against the Pirates, Mets manager Terry Collins said Cespedes was expected to play in his second rehab game Saturday with St. Lucie, but was not the lineup. The team revealed around 10 p.m that Cespedes had experienced discomfort although Collins had not mentioned any possible issues hours earlier. Cespedes went 0-for-2 with a walk and run scored in his first rehab game Friday while playing six innings in left field for St. Lucie. "They thought he swung the bat alright," Collins said before Saturday's game. "He's anxious to get back in there (Saturday) and see how he does." Cespedes battled quad issues last year and a strained quad landed him on the disabled list, but this recent trip to the disabled list was due to a strained left hamstring. The team had been anticipating a possible return during the upcoming series against Milwaukee. "No matter what we do it's not working," Collins said after the 5-4 loss in 10 innings. Collins said he is planning to talk to his outfielders when Cespedes returns and explain to them how the playing time will be divided. Curtis Granderson is expected to move to a bench role with Cespedes, Michael Conforto and Jay Bruce starting. "When Ces gets back, I know him, and he'll want to play every game, and we can't afford to lose him for another month so he'll be getting time off," Collins said. Rotation update Newcomer Tyler Pill is slated to start Tuesday against Milwaukee barring a possible rainout Sunday, according to a source. The team's only options on the roster are Pill or Josh Smoker, and the Mets will use Pill, who was promoted Friday. If the team's game Sunday against Pittsburgh is rained out, which is a possibility due to rain in the forecast, the Mets would not need Pill to step into the rotation that day since they could push back a day both Matt Harvey and Robert Gsellman. The Mets' plans could also be altered if a starter has to depart a game prematurely. Rehabbing starters Steven Matz (elbow) or Seth Lugo (elbow) are not options since they are making rehab starts Sunday. Matz will pitch for Class AAA Las Vegas while Lugo will start for Class AA Binghamton, and they will toss around 80 pitches. Lugo is not eligible to be activated to the roster until Thursday at the earliest. Pill made his debut Saturday and allowed the loss by allowing one run in 2/3 innings, but Collins said Pill would be good to go if needed Tuesday. "I would say it would be a lot easier," Pill said of making a start after his debut. Third base Jose Reyes started at third base instead of Wilmer Flores for the second straight day since Asdrubal Cabrera returned to the lineup, and Collins attributed that to Reyes' hitting well lately and lefties faring better against righties Chad Kuhl and Gerrit Cole. "We just run into these streaks where we (face) all these right-handed pitchers," Collins said. "With our switch-hitters we have, it's nice to get them in there and kind of alter those left-handed relievers. We'll play it by ear." Collins said Conforto needs a day off soon since "he's getting a little fatigued." ...Harvey starts Sunday's series finale and is coming off a win against San Diego in which he allowed two runs in five innings. He has never beaten Pittsburgh in three career starts.

All top-level hospitals in Jiangsu province will stop treating outpatients with antibiotic drips from July 1 next year. Prescription antibiotic drips will be prohibited in all of the province's level-three hospitals, the highest level in China, according to the Jiangsu Health and Family Planning Commission. The pilot scheme is an escalation of China's campaign to overhaul the clinical use of antibiotics. Outpatient departments in these hospitals will stop providing such treatments altogether by the end of next year. Only inpatient and emergency departments will continue the use of antibiotic drips for adults. Level-3 pediatric hospitals will be exempt from the new regulation, according to the provincial commission. "This confirms the national health authorities' determination to crack down on clinical antibiotic abuse that is leading to rising levels of antibiotic resistance across the country," said Peng Qingyu, professor of health economics at Shandong University. In Nanjing, Jiangsu's capital, about 200,000 patients receive antibiotic drips annually in level-3 hospitals, accounting for 10 percent of all inpatient treatments, according to Xinhua News Agency. A recent multicountry survey from the WHO shows people are confused about the threat posed to public health by antibiotic resistance and do not understand how to prevent it. "The rise of antibiotic resistance is a global health crisis, and governments around the world now recognize it as one of the greatest challenges for public health," said Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization, in the survey report. "Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat infectious diseases and undermining many advances in medicine." In China, the survey, which polled 1,000 people, showed that 57 percent had taken antibiotics within the past six months and 74 percent of those were prescribed or provided by a doctor or nurse. More than half wrongly believed that they should stop taking antibiotics when they feel better, while 61 percent of respondents thought, incorrectly, that colds and flu could be treated by antibiotics. "Antibiotic drips have been very popular since I was a child," said Luo Changyuan, 52, director of a county-level clinic in Anhui province. "It takes effect much sooner than pills. People cared more about how fast they could get recovery, rather than the side effects of the antibiotics." The Anhui provincial health department released a list of 53 diseases that do not need to be treated with antibiotics in August last year. The authority asked all clinics and hospitals to reduce the number of drips used on inpatients by 25 percent within the year, which they have achieved. Luo said reducing antibiotic drips was more challenging in rural areas because most patients were not severely sick but still wanted a fast recovery. The National Health and Family Planning Commission estimated that an average of 138 grams of antibiotics were used per person on the Chinese mainland in 2010. That is nearly 10 times the amount used in the United States. The commission's statistics also show that 70 percent of inpatients and 50 percent of outpatients in China are given prescriptions for antibiotics. In August last year, the commission launched a nationwide system to document cases of antibiotic-resistant bacteria at 1,349 large public hospitals nationwide. "Hopefully, when large hospitals are able to successfully control the use of antibiotics, they will set an example for grassroots institutions," Peng said. In today's trending, controversy as a historical villa becomes a McDonald's, a "flying superman" causes a stir in Guangdong, and milk sold directly from a cow in Gansu.

Q: Collaboration from PlayN client with server I have written a game in PlayN, which has to communicate with a JavaEE-Server with Seam. First of all I only need the game running in HTML5. The current issue is the communication between the PlayN-client and the JavaEE-Server 1) First I tried to communicate over the PlayN.net() interface exchanging information using JSON. Since PlayN is running on port 8888 and the server on 8080 I correctly run into problems with the same-origin-policy. 2) Now I'm looking for a working solution. Which one would you recommend? Do you have other ideas? a) I'm trying to work with RPC as described in How to handle RPCs in client-server PlayN game? , using GWT-syncproxy. b) I try that playN runs on the same port as the server i.e. 8080 - so I don't have problems with the same-origin-policy any more. Question: Can the HTML5 playN app run on the same port? So when I start the JavaEE-Server using Eclipse it should also start the PlayN web application, both on port 8080, right? Is this possible? c) The most hacky solution (currently working): The server writes the JSON-String into a file and the playN client reads this file out. What do you recommend? I'd like to implement solution 2, since it is the cleanest solution, but I don't know how hard it is and how it works. Thanks for your help! A: I think the problem is that you are "running" PlayN, separated from your Seam server. If I understood you correctly, you execute the Maven task to run your game as HTML and on the other hand you run Jboss (or whatever Java EE server), what you should do is run mvn package which will create the war of the game, and then publish that war on your Java EE server, then you can use the PlayN.net package with no problems whatsoever, running in a single server A: This is how we currently handle our client / server communication. We are using a stateless JavaEE architecture and provide everything as REST services. This allows us to scale horizontally by adding more servers and simply adding them to the cluster entry in the Glassfish config. However due to missing reflection or a working JSON lib, it forces us to implement a toJson()method in every data transfer object BY HAND (be carfull with case sensitivity). We added our server project as a module to the PlayN metaproject and added the core as a dependency to the server. So you can place every DTO on the core project (which is quite awesome). Placing them on the server results in people trying to annotate the classes as entities, which will result in failure during the html build. I am currently thinking about adding a shared project to the build, like in GWT projects. This is how we send data to the server (for this example without any abstraction, do yourself a favor and implement one): private void loadMapFromServer() { SessionDto session = this.main.getSessionCtrl().getSessionMdl(); PlayN.net().post("http://localhost:8080/server/rest/map/mapMdl", session.toJson(), new Callback<String>() { @Override public void onSuccess(String result) { mapMdl = new MapDto(); } @Override public void onFailure(Throwable cause) { PlayN.log().error("fail " + cause.getMessage()); } }); } Notice how we bastardize the POST argument with session.toJson(). This is because of the missing MIME type feature and passing JSON strings via GWT will fail. And this is how it looks on the server: package com.fact.server; //I also posted the imports, for clarity. import com.fact.core.map.MapDto; import com.fact.core.user.SessionDto; import com.fact.server.game.map.MapCtrl; import com.google.gson.Gson; import javax.ejb.Stateless; import javax.inject.Inject; import javax.ws.rs.POST; import javax.ws.rs.Path; import javax.ws.rs.Produces; import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType; import org.apache.log4j.Logger; @Stateless @Path("/map") public class MapSrvs { @Inject Logger logger; @Inject MapCtrl mapCtrl; Gson gson = new Gson(); @POST @Path("/mapMdl/") @Produces( MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON ) public MapDto getMapMdl(String sessionDtoStr) { //logger.info("map was requested: " + sessionDtoStr); // Use gson to deserialize the class. Jersey would do this, if PlayN // would allow to set a correct MIME type (and @Consumes was set). // We could simply write: getMapMdl(SessionDto sessionDto) SessionDto sessionDto = gson.fromJson(sessionDtoStr, SessionDto.class); if(sessionDto == null) { return null; } // [...] check for a valid session MapDto mapMdl = new MapDto(); mapMdl.foo = "message from server"; return mapMdl; } } This would be a bit nicer, if PlayN would allow you to set the MIME type, so that you won't have to cast the String using Gson. However this works quite well. We use Jersey on the server side to handle all the REST stuff. To get it running I had to put the following into the web.xml: <servlet> <!-- We need jersey for the REST stuff --> <servlet-name>jersey-serlvet</servlet-name> <servlet-class> com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainer </servlet-class> <init-param> <param-name>com.sun.jersey.config.property.packages</param-name> <param-value>com.fact.server</param-value> </init-param> <init-param> <!-- This took me hours to find :(. It is needed to automatically map POJOs to JSON code. --> <param-name>com.sun.jersey.api.json.POJOMappingFeature</param-name> <param-value>true</param-value> </init-param> <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup> </servlet> <servlet-mapping> <servlet-name>jersey-serlvet</servlet-name> <url-pattern>/rest/*</url-pattern> </servlet-mapping> Also Jersey is already included into the Java-EE-Api, so it works out of the box. I hope this helps. If anyone knows how to do client side JSON parsing , please look at this question: How do I convert a POJO to JSON in PlayN?
Facebook is an ever changing medium for social discourse with more than 750 million active users. On September 21st, the Facebook algorithm changed to no longer broadcast the most recent posts of friends and groups an individual is associated with. Instead Facebook now displays the most recent posts in response to an individuals search terms, interests and interactions. The new algorithm divides news updates into two categories, "Top Stories" and a "News Reel". The "News Reel" is located on the right side of the screen, this new feature now allows an individual to view everything that people are posting, liking and tagging because it is constantly updating. To view more on what appears in the reel, hover over the content and click on the down arrow that appears. To close it isn't an option. However, you can hide a story by clicking the down arrow. Status updates and photos have a new look on an individual's homepage. They are now labeled with a blue corner for easy view ability. This is a great opportunity for dealerships who understand how to use social media. Now, more then ever before a dealership can connect and engage their audience and get rid of the background noise. Facebook for dealerships is all about connecting with customers and the public, as well as brand building. These are two important practices that are enhanced by the Facebook format change.

Home Sports "Say It Ain't…" "Say It Ain't…" Major Garrett Spring training is two parts performance and ten parts injury avoidance. The only score that matters after each game is number of players injured. The closer the Padres stay to zero the better. The other iron rule of Spring Training is what happens before the games — the pick-off moves, the bunting drills, the fluidity of situational infield movements, the refinements of angles outfielders take to fly balls in the gaps — matters more than all box scores combined. Other than injury tallies, game statistics are rubbish. This is a time of anticipation, anxiety and hope — for all fans, not just us; we do have much more experience with anxiety than most, some experience with hope and almost none with anticipation. It is therefore time to ponder deeper issues with the great game of baseball. It is suffering its greatest crisis since the Black Sox Scandal of 1919. It's hard to make sense of history when you're living it. Trust me, the time I am spending now in Washington will be recorded in books for decades to come. I drown daily in history's deluge, unable to catalog or comprehend it all. Baseball is changing before our very eyes. A World Series Trophy is worth less than a garbage can lid; lawsuits allege career-altering cheating; Mike Fiers, the courageous whistle-blower, fears in-game retaliation or worse; the commissioner's office keeps revising its account of unearthing the unholy mess. Spring is not supposed to smell. This season dawns in stench. Conspiracy. Cowardice. Deceit. The Astros lead the league in all three. Listen to the game's best players – Mike Trout, Aaron Judge, Cody Bellinger – and you know it's not over. Before apologists cloud the issue, the question is not whether stealing signs made the Astros World Champions. The question is what defect made the Astros so contemptuous of baseball, its fans, its history and their own honor to systematically defraud all of them and then cynically celebrate as deserving innocents? Say it ain't so. While we are on that topic, let's clear up another matter. "Say it ain't so, Joe" never happened. It was never said. It is a part of baseball lore, a poignant and poetic refrain too good to ignore and therefore too good to correct. Just like "Nice guys finish last." That wasn't said either. Baseball fans know them as well as lyrics from a favorite song or a Bible verse. What we know isn't always true. What we knew about the 2017 World Series wasn't either. What we know about the 2018 World Series might not be either, hear that, Boston Red Sox? Unspooling both of these myths might help us put some of today's history in context. That is my effort here. Back to "Say it ain't so." In his lovely book, Nice Guys Finish Seventh, Ralph Keyes dissects the artful deception that gave us "Say it ain't so" and "Nice Guys Finish Last." Quick review of the first. The Chicago White Sox were accused of throwing the 1919 World Series in exchange for payoffs from gamblers. There was a trial in 1920 in Chicago. As Keyes writes: "The baseball players' sin cast a pall over America's secular religion. Not just baseball but the American sense of self was on trial." As the story goes, Joe Jackson, known widely as "Shoeless Joe," exited the courthouse after testifying before a grand jury. There was a crowd. Jackson pushed through. Sportswriter Hugh Fullerton filed this account of Jackson: "He did not swagger. He slunk along between the guardians, and the kids, with wide eyes and tightening throats watched, and one, bolder than the others, pressed forward and said: 'It ain't so, Joe, is it?' 'Yes, kid. I'm afraid it is.' And the world of faith crashed around the heads of the kids. Their idol lay in dust, their faith destroyed." Over the years, "It ain't so, Joe, is it?" morphed into "Say it ain't so, Joe." Keyes also notes Jackson forever denied saying anything to anyone other than a deputy sheriff who escorted him through the throng. But the legend and the fallacy persist. Same with "Nice Guys Finish Last." This supposed bit of baseball wisdom has transcended the sport to become a cautionary warning about playing by the rules, living decently and falling steadily behind — inevitably and as if by some writ of Darwinian justice. It was never said. It was barely implied. In July of 1946 Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher, as cussed a skipper as there was in the game, was running down the crosstown rival New York Giants. The Dodgers' radio announcer, Red Barber, leaned on Durocher to ease up. "Why don't you be a nice guy for a change?" As Keyes writes: "Durocher leaped to his feet. 'A nice guy?' he shouted. 'I been around in baseball for a long time and I've known a lot of nice guys. But I never saw a nice guy who was any good when you needed him. Go up to one of those nice guys some time when you need a hundred to get you out of a jam and he'll always give you that, 'Sorry, pal. I'd like to help you but things are not going so good at the ranch.' That's what they'll give you, those nice guys. I'll take the guys who ain't nice. The guys who would put you in a cement mixer if they felt like it. But you get in a jam and you don't have to go to them. They'll come looking for you and say 'How much do you need?' Durocher pointed at the Giants' dugout, saying 'Nice guys! Look over there. Do you know a nicer guy than (Giants manager) Mel Ott? Or any of the other Giants? Why they're the nicest guys in the world! And where are they? In seventh place!'" The point wasn't that being a nice guy made you a loser. Durocher said his experience with "nice guys" taught him they were phonies who never came through in tough times. But gritty guys who knew hardship, who scrapped and clawed and got mean doing it, did. Nice wasn't about losing. It was about hypocrisy. In the Shoeless Joe Jackson story, if it is to be believed, a question was asked of the fallen hero that tried to get to the heart of the entire mess: "It ain't so, Joe, is it" is not asking Joe to deny something already believed that is crushing; rather it is asking the player at the center of the storm if this terrible thing is as real and genuinely terrible as it sounds? "Yes, kid, I'm afraid it is." Durocher did not say being nice made you a loser. He said being undependable, weak and two-faced did. In this modern crisis wrought by the Astros and possibly others, it's time to remember the importance of that question to Jackson and Durocher's denunciation of two-bit phonies. Baseball will be saved by players and front offices who remember these stories — the accurate versions — for what they say about scandal, hypocrisy and lying first to yourself and then the world.

Everyone talks about customer engagement. You know yourself when you have engagement you'll grow your business with social proof. So why is it such a struggle for you to fall in love with customer engagement in a way that makes it something you enjoy doing? There are many advantages to getting a social media manager to run things for you. Perhaps the most obvious upside is that you're freeing up some of your own time, allowing you to focus on other things in your business.

I love that the shirt was not heavy weight. The sleeves, however, were so small at the bicep area. Too bad, I love the saying on the shirt. Should I order again, I will order a much better quality shirt. This shirt is so thin that I can read the screen of my phone through it. I expected a higher quality fabric. Unfortunately, the print/design on the shirt is rather small and gets lost in the shirt. The font of the words/print should have been larger making it easy to read and filling more of the shirt up. Not thrilled, I just spent *** on something to lounge around since you can't really read it.

On the 1st of May 2017, I organized a soap-making workshop with the association "Paramo Permacultura Colombia" in Paipa (Colombia). We used recycled oil from the cooking of typical colombian "arepas"(flat bread) and caustic soda. Angela and Gregory, the permaculture teachers of the association, are used to live a DIY life and they were very eager to learn the procedure of soap-making. We filtered the used oil, we made the soap and we added some lavender oil for a nice scent. The final products were awesome! I am an enthusiast researcher with the obsession for recycling, permaculture, renewable energy and of course, eco soap-making. I literally bounced into joosoap when surfing on the web and I got impressed seeing how somebody else in the world had an idea similar to mine about used oil for soap making as a way to reduce waste and environment damaging. I proudly enrolled as the first Joosoap Ambassador in south america. To the adventure .....!!!!
Prep Spotlight: After team meeting, Ignacio's Brunson steps up for Bobcats Sophomore shows leadership qualities Tuesday, Jan. 22, 2019 8:53 PM Updated: Tuesday, Jan. 22, 2019 10:57 PM Only a sophomore, Ignacio's Jayden Brunson has already begun to leave her mark on the Ignacio High School girls basketball team. Joel Priest/Pine River Times file Jayden Brunson knew something was amiss after the Ignacio High School girls basketball team was thrashed in an 18-point loss to Alamosa on Jan. 5 in the first game back from holiday break. The following Monday, the sophomore guard called a team meeting to discuss what the team could do better. "I just knew that we had to fix some things before it could get worse," Brunson said. "I understand it. I mean, we're girls; we're teenage girls on a basketball team, so of course, we're going to have a bit of attitude. It was just like reminding them that there's no room for this if we have these goals we want to achieve. "For me, personally, I was like, 'We have zero room for error, and no time for any of this extra stuff.' ... Once we talked about what needed to change, it's like we suddenly just clicked. Three weeks later, we're a new team." Brunson, daughter of Jaydee and Melanie Brunson, also talked about expectations with new head coach Justa Whitt, who is in her second stint with IHS. In a team with three seniors, Whitt was impressed to see an underclassman speak up. "She's been trying to step up as a leader," Whitt said. "She showed that by being one of the ones who called the team meeting to address our issues and move forward. It shows great growth for a young kid, and I think ... she's at a stage where she needs to build some confidence, and she has become a great defensive player, but she still needs to grow in other areas like shooting and passing. But once she gets going, she's on." Brunson was a freshman on last year's team that reached the state tournament. In the 2A District 3 Tournament championship game, she scored a game-high 14 points for Ignacio against Dolores. Many of the Bobcats from that team returned this season. Ignacio's Jayden Brunson was deadly to Dolores in the 2018 2A District 3 Tournament championship played at Montezuma-Cortez High School. Brunson sank four 3-pointers and totaled a game-best 14 points, as IHS blew out DHS 46-11. "Having a year of experience has helped everybody, and with a big group of girls that has had that experience of going to state, some with two years, they understand how hard it is to get there," Whitt said. "It helps us all around." Since the team meeting, practices have been more productive, team morale and chemistry has finally clicked and new offensive and defensive sets have improved. Ignacio (8-4, 7-0 2A/1A San Juan Basin League) as it has won five consecutive games. One area of the floor that Ignacio has succeeded in all season, has been its defense. The Bobcats have outscored their opponents by 209 points and have held opponents to under 30 points six times, including two games in which they held their opponents to less than 10 points. "We've been working on defense since the season began," Brunson said. "It's always one of the things that coach has been stressing, and we want to continue to only get better as the season goes on." Ignacio sophomore Jayden Brunson has been an all-around threat for the Ignacio Bobcats en route to an unbeaten mark in league play thus far. From a team meeting to the new coach, Brunson said the last two seasons have reminded her a lot of her favorite sports movie "Hoosiers." The famed 1986 film stars Gene Hackman, a new coach in small-town, basketball-mad Indiana who leads a team of underdogs to a state championship title. "We've got a new coach this year, and in our little town basketball is one of the things that brings everybody together," Brunson said. "One of my favorite parts of the movie is when (Gene Hackman) measures the basket at the state championship and reminds them it's still 10 feet. It was a similar moment for me last year. I was a freshman, and Ignacio was in the state tournament. It was so relatable, and I think given how we're playing, we can definitely be the underdogs who make it back this year." Ignacio will look to continue winning ways on the road against Nucla at 2 p.m. Saturday. bploen@ durangoherald.com What is your favorite sports movie?: "Hoosiers." It's always been a movie that my dad and I watch. What is your favorite song?: "Jump Around" by House of Pain. We always listen to it a lot before games. What is your dream car?: I don't know that I've got a dream car, but I've always wanted a Jeep. Who is your favorite athlete?: Kawhi Leonard. What is your favorite book?: "A Child Called 'It'" by Dave Pelzer. What do you like to eat before a game?: I usually eat Subway. If you could have any superpower, what would you pick?: The ability to read other people's minds because it would be cool to know what they're thinking. If you could take a trip anywhere in the world, where would you go?: Hawaii, and in particular, Kauai, because of the beaches and scenery. What is your favorite outdoor activity?: Snowshoeing at Spring Creek, just outside of Ignacio. What teacher has had a big impact on your life?: Mr. Tony Kimball. He teaches math at IHS, and always takes the extra time to go over things. Do you have a role model?: My dad. He's always taught me to play with heart and to always give it my all.

Q: is there any script which can stop to show ALT="text" as a tooltip in IE 6 and 7? is there any script which can stop to show ALT="text" as a tooltip in IE 6 and 7? A: I wouldn't worry too much about it. It's a known bug and it's fixed in IE8. A: $('img').each(function (i, el) { if (!el.hasAttribute('title')) { el.setAttribute('title', ''); } }); That should give all images without a title attribute an empty one. I'm not sure if it will fix the problem for IE6 and IE7 but I think they support title and this might override it. A: <!--[if IE]><script>for(i =0;i<document.images.length;i++){document.images[i].alt='';}</script><![endif]--> at the end of the page should do it. A: In IE before IE8 the only way to avoid the browser to show images alt text as tooltip are: * *not to use the alt attribute (which is not a good idea because it's not valid HTML and it's not good even for Google SEO and text readers that can not see your images). *place in each image a title="" empty attribute. In order to accomplish point (2) using a simple Javascript with no jQuery, you have to place this small piece of code before ending BODY tag, like this: <!--[if lt IE 8]> <script> for(var i = 0, imgs = document.images, len = imgs.length; i < len; ++i) if(!imgs[i].title) imgs[i].title = ""; </script> <![endif]--> </body> You can write it in one line if you prefer. The advantaghe of this code is that it does not screw up the alt tag attributes of your images, it simply sets the title attribute to empty string, unless a title attribute is already defined in this last case I suppose the title attribute was defined because you want to show whatever you wrote in title attribute as a tooltip (which is a cross-browser behaviour). A: $$('img').set('alt', ''); No other way, apart from setting the title attribute. A: You could do the following but it would be very intrusive (and a bit slow): $('*').attr('alt', ''); A: Presumably for alt attribute, you just mean image elements? $('img').removeAttr('alt'); You may also consider removing the title attribute from elements in the DOM $('*').removeAttr('title'); A: Do screan reader run javascript? If not then why bother with this mod? Setting alt to "" would hide the alt "tooltip" in IE < 8 which seems to be all you are after. Plus this should be done anyway for all image or else screen readers have a habit of of rendering out a default "image placeholder" speech. If you set it to blank then it won't bother and will skip it, ideal for images that are simply used for design rather than content. Unfortunately there is no special flag or switch you can flick via JS or any other method to tell IE to behave any differently in this regard which is what I believe you are asking for. An alternative is to switch any alts you find in images to be titles but this does not get rid of the tooltips, you just end up making them appear in all browsers then rather than just IE. So the final fix is to simply clear all alt attributes in images (and there are scripts in other answers here that do just that). You asked the question but I think you should ponder about what it is you are trying to achieve and more importantly, why and is it that essential?

5 Secrets You Didn't Know About Nancy Drew By: Kathryn Whitbourne | Updated: Apr 16, 2021 Bonita Granville stars in the 1938 movie "Nancy Drew - Detective." LMPC via Getty Images Back in 1930, a certain "girl sleuth" appeared on the scene driving a sporty blue roadster at top speed as she solved mysteries in books with names like "The Hidden Staircase" and "The Mystery at Lilac Inn." Who could this be? Why, Nancy Drew of course. "Nancy Drew grew out of the Depression and wanting to give children something to think about other than problems at home," said Nancy Axelrod, a writer and editor involved with the syndicate that published the Nancy Drew books, in the book "Nancy Drew and Company." Throughout the decades, and various iterations, the fictional heroine has remained very popular. Here are five secrets we've uncovered about Nancy Drew. 1. Who Was Carolyn Keene? Carolyn Keene is listed as the author of all the Nancy Drew books. But there was no such person. From the beginning, there was a stable of writers for the series, none of whom had that name. Twenty-three of the first 30 books were written by a journalist named Mildred Wirt Benson, under the direction of Edward Stratemeyer, who developed several series books for children (Ever read the Hardy Boys, Bobbsey Twins or Tom Swift? Those were his creations too.) Stratemeyer came up with the characters and outlines and farmed out the content to various ghostwriters to finish. But you could say that Benson was the one who made Nancy what she became. Tired of the "namby-pamby" girls' series of the time, Benson made Nancy an independent, adventurous girl (with her own car!) who solved mysteries by herself, occasionally referring to her father Carson Drew, a lawyer, for advice. "I sort of liked the character from the beginning," Benson told The New York Times in 1993. "Now that kind of woman is common, but then it was a new concept, though not to me. I just naturally thought that girls could do the things boys did." Yet, she added shockingly, "I'm so sick of Nancy Drew I could vomit." Another series writer was Harriet Stratemeyer Adams (Edward's daughter) who wrote Nos. 33-56, plus No. 31. And a handful of men also ghostwrote as well. 2. Why Did Nancy Drew Change? Edward Stratemeyer died suddenly in 1930, the same year the series premiered, and Harriett Adams took over the syndicate. Under her guidance, Nancy underwent a heavy revision in 1959, becoming more sedate and less snooty. Take, for instance, the first book "The Secret of the Old Clock." "1930 Nancy was more emotional and chided herself. She was a little less perfect and more real," wrote Nancy Drew expert Jennifer Fisher. "1930 Nancy referred to the Topham girls as 'vapid creatures' and said they do not deserve the Crowley fortune. By 1959, this rather un-Nancy like behavior was shouldered upon Hannah Gruen." In the revision, Nancy aged from 16 to 18 (so she could legally drive in all 50 states), exchanged her roadster for a convertible (to keep up with the times) and had more of a familial relationship with the housekeeper Hannah Gruen; originally, she played more of a servant role. Hannah, who was invariably described as "motherly," provided a somewhat parental figure for Nancy, whose mother, we're given to understand, died when Nancy was 3. But at the same time she wasn't so much of a parent as to forbid Nancy from undertaking her various adventures. Adams also removed some of the racially stereotypical characters that had clouded the original series. In 2004, another set of revisions followed, which put the Nancy Drew books into the first person, and had her tooling around in a hybrid vehicle (still blue) and helping Hannah with domestic chores. Her best friends remained the "pleasantly plump" Bess Marvin and her cousin, the athletic tomboy George Fayne. 3. Is It True the Critics Hated the Books? Yes, even wholesome Nancy was not a universal favorite with adults when she first debuted. Many librarians considered these books to be "trash" and a "menace to good reading" because of their formulaic plots and characters. In 1957, writer Phyllis Fenner complained that Nancy was "saucy" and "strongheaded" while performing "all kinds of stunts, [and solving] mysteries involving high-powered cars and expensive perfumes." Opposition largely fell away as educators began embracing series books, comics and graphic novels as ways to get children to get more interested in reading. 4. What Became of Helen Corning? You remember her? She was Nancy's sidekick in the early books before Bess and George showed up. In the original series Helen Corning was portrayed as a bit of a gossip who was always up for some fun. She popped in and out of several books, subbing for Bess and George when they weren't available; she also happened to date Buck Rodman, Ned Nickerson's roommate (Ned was Nancy's "steady," as they used to say.) In the 1959 revisions, Helen Corning got engaged in the second book "The Hidden Staircase" and by the 10th, "The Passage to Larkspur Lane," she was married to Jim Archer, and hardly seen again — which allowed Bess and George to assume bigger roles. Decades later, Helen was resurrected as part of the newer incarnation of the series, "Nancy Drew, Girl Detective" which ran 2004-2012. 5. How Many Nancy Drew Books Are There? Harriet Stratemeyer Adams died in 1982, and the series syndicate was sold to Simon and Schuster who went to work creating a whole lot of spinoffs, many of which Adams would not have approved of. "I feel you overstepped your position in trying to revamp Nancy's character," Adams wrote to an editor back when she was warring with the previous publisher Grosset and Dunlap. "She is not all those dreadful things you accuse her of and in many instances you have actually wanted to make her negative. And don't forget, every Shakespearian tragedy has plenty of humor in it!" The classic series ran to 56 books, but the current total is over 175. Let's see if you can keep all these spinoffs straight: In the 1980s, there was the Nancy Drew files (which lasted for 125 books) and was more focused on romance as well as mystery. The "On Campus" series of the 1990s had Nancy attending Wilder University, while the "Nancy Drew Notebooks" targeted the very young with stories about Nancy and her friends in elementary school. The current incarnation of the classic Nancy Drew series is called "The Nancy Drew Diaries" and debuted in 2013. Nevertheless, the books will sound familiar to any Nancy Drew reader, past or present: "Nancy, Bess, and George race to catch an international jewel thief" reads the synopsis for "The Stolen Show." Now That Hurts Nancy Drew expert Jennifer Fisher estimated that Nancy was knocked unconscious 19 times, kidnapped 16 times and locked in an elevator once, among other catastrophes.

Technology – most notably chatbots – have changed the face of customer service. They offer customers instant access to personalized advice and answers at virtually any time of day, all at a fraction of the cost of many other customer service channels. These capabilities have caught the attention of execs in a range of industries and put chatbots at the center of an increasing number of business strategies, as more and more organizations look for ways to improve customer service while simultaneously cutting costs. As chatbots and automation become increasingly prevalent – Gartner projects that by 2020, more than 85% of customer interactions will be handled without a human agent – it's caused some concern over how the job market will be impacted, specifically, whether chatbots and AI might soon make human agents obsolete. While there is no denying AI will cause some disruption, it's not all doom and gloom. In fact, a number of industry experts seem to agree that moving forward, AI will be most effective working alongside humans; for organizations to truly benefit, their focus must be on worker augmentation, not replacement. To help your organization prepare for the future of customer service, we've compiled excerpts from a number of industry analysts as they offer their perspectives – good or bad – into the future of bots and human agents, along with potential pitfalls to avoid and ideas on how to find a workable balance. "AI's potential to reduce staff head count attracts the attention of senior business executives as a potential cost-saving initiative. A more informed expectation, however, would be for applications that help and improve human endeavors, as AI promises benefits far beyond automation. Organizations that embrace this perspective are more likely to find workers eager to embrace AI. "As intelligent enterprises integrate AI technologies into their systems, customers and employees will expect even more from these interactions. As artificial intelligence becomes people's "go-to" technology, it will require enterprises to step up to a new challenge: creating responsible AI. This not only has business implications, but also individual and societal implications. AI will be successful only if it's adopted by people, and it will only be successful it if helps provide better outcomes for people and society. "AI-driven chatbots are extensively being used in customer support. The idea is to take over the initial interaction with customers and route them to different places based on the queries. It has been speculated by the ever foreseeing herd that these intelligent algorithms will eventually eat up the jobs of customer support agents and are here to replace them. But…chatbots are here to assist humans in providing a faster, contextual and better support experience. "Globally, 31% of firms Forrester surveyed were using chatbots in 2016 or planned to do so in 2017. Many companies are chomping at the bit to replace human agents with virtual ones, especially when they see claims of deflection rates of up to 80%. Giving customers the ability to stay in a text channel and receive real-time guidance from chatbots, live chat agents, or a combination of both will be a growing trend. "The 2017 Top of Mind Survey reveals that early adopters of AI and robotics among manufacturers and retailers in the consumer goods industry have a variety of motives. The most obvious one, lowering operating costs, is cited as a key benefit by 27 percent of businesses using basic robotics and by 23 percent of those investing in cognitive robotics (AI-powered machines that can learn). "Travel companies are investing in artificial intelligence, but that doesn't mean fewer jobs for humans… Artificial intelligence can replace some existing jobs, and managers have to take care of what the next step for people is, that is relevant in the data world. "We will see 'technological unemployment,'" says Professor Ryan Abbott, professor of law and health sciences at the University of Surrey, but if a chatbot gives hotel recommendations based on reviews and your preferences, rather than plugging a relative's place, maybe that's for the best. "It comes as no surprise that artificial intelligence (AI) tops the list of potentially disruptive technologies. Vast amounts of processable data and techniques such as machine learning have made it possible to create algorithms capable of outperforming humans at detecting trends, making predictions and taking appropriate action. In the financial sector, legions of smart machines are taking over a wide range of tasks that were once the preserve of human workers. Jörn Leogrande, vice president mobile services at payment platform Wirecard, says that while machine learning still requires humans to be involved in some of the more complex decisions, these tools are increasingly being used for customer-facing activities. "Providers of financial services are using AI to make predictions about customers' behavior, which can then be used to push certain products, reduce churn and create market insights for product and brand development," he says. Automation technologies including artificial intelligence and robotics will generate significant benefits for users, businesses, and economies, lifting productivity and economic growth. The extent to which these technologies displace workers will depend on the pace of their development and adoption, economic growth, and growth in demand for work. Even as it causes declines in some occupations, automation will change many more—60 percent of occupations have at least 30 percent of constituent work activities that could be automated. It will also create new occupations that do not exist today, much as technologies of the past have done. For retailers, one of the main appeals of AI is its ability to measure and monitor shoppers' behavior, and then adapt the customer journey accordingly to offer a personalized experience. "Artificial intelligence could eliminate many white-collar jobs in coming decades. Its effects are already being felt in the call center industry, but there is still no substitute for the human touch. The development of bots and automated messaging is already changing the world of call centers, which are often thought to be one of the company departments most at risk of becoming obsolete in a world of artificial intelligence. "US consumers appear to be warming up to the idea of using of chatbots as a customer relationship management (CRM) tool, according to new research from Aspect Software Research. In its online survey of more than 1,000 18- to 65-year-old US consumers, 44% said that if a company could get the experience right, they would prefer to use a chatbot or automated experience for CRM. The technology could have the potential to help businesses significantly cut labor costs. While complete automation of the customer service workforce is not feasible, automating customer management and sales positions in the US where possible through chatbots and other automation technologies could result in considerable savings.

IAMHIGHER: Latest statistics of population in the country of Sweden, including languages spoken, urban population, birth rate, fertility rate and life expectancy for both men and women. The population consists mainly of Swedes, Sami and Finns only live in the very thinly populated north (Lapland). In the second half of the 20th century, an increasing number of foreign workers and refugees came to the country. The share of foreigners in the total population is (2017) 8.42%. In addition, there were 241,000 asylum seekers (at the end of 2017). With an average of 25 residents / km 2 (2017), Sweden is very sparsely populated in a European comparison. Check campingship to see Brief Information About Sweden. Most of the population lives in southern and central Sweden (south of the latitude of Gävle). In contrast, the administrative districts of Jämtland, Västerbotten and Norrbotten are only very sparsely populated with around 50% of the total land area. A lack of economic prospects is causing many northern Swedes to migrate to the southern metropolitan areas. Overall, 86% of the population live in urban settlements. The largest metropolitan areas are Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. Social: With regard to professional and social equality of women and their sexual self-determination, Sweden has made progress like hardly any other country. The employment rate for women is the highest in the European Union, which has also been achieved through a wide range of childcare facilities in day-care centers.

Since the introduction of the Reformation in Sweden (1527), the majority of Swedish Christians have belonged to the Evangelical Lutheran "Church of Sweden" ("Svenska Kyrkan"), which was the state church from 1527 to 1999. Religious freedom was enshrined in law in 1951. Since then, every citizen has the right to withdraw from the Lutheran Church, to which, as a state church, all citizens were assigned "by birth" until the official recording practice was abolished in 1995 (decision of the government and church synod). Following the tradition of the Swedish royal family, the king belongs to the Evangelical Lutheran »Svenska Kyrkan«; until 1999 also obliged under state church law to today only "voluntarily" as a member of the traditional national church of Sweden. This structurally consists of an archbishopric and thirteen dioceses; the Archbishop of Uppsala (since 2014 Antje Jackelén, of German descent; with her, a woman was elected to this office for the first time in 2013) is Prima inter Pares (of the other bishops) and as such the highest representative of her church. The church's legislative competence has been exclusively with the church synod since 2000 (until then with the Reichstag). Today around 45% of all people who hold a priesthood in the »Svenska Kyrkan« are women. with her a woman was elected to this office for the first time in 2013) is Prima inter Pares (of the other bishops) and as such the highest representative of her church.

Perkins: Secretariat one of a kind By Dave PerkinsSports Columnist Fri., Oct. 15, 2010timer3 min. read With all respect to Redwood, Chinchon, Marsh Side and other worthies chasing the best portion of $2 million Saturday at Woodbine in the Canadian International, it's safe to say no one will park in knee-deep mud for a chance to see them run 1½ miles. This isn't 1973, when Secretariat packed them in for his final career race, adding a thick chapter to this country's thoroughbred history and delivering to the Canadian International, now sponsored by Pattison, a stature the race has earned and enjoyed since. There's plenty of talk these days about Secretariat, thanks to the new Disney movie that tells his story, although as usual, Hollywood takes a good story and torques it beyond the point of credulity. Most racing movies seem to contain exactly the same scene: The hero animal is hopelessly last, owners anxiously wilting in the grandstand, before the jock leans forward and says, "Okay, boy. Let's go'' at exactly the instant someone in the grandstand half a mile away — usually someone too young to bet — shouts, "Now!'' And you know what happens next: In about a six-minute race, he passes two dozen horses to beat his arch rival (and shut up his nasty owner) going away. This one has plenty of silly stuff mixed in with some nice racing footage, but it's akin to one of those old Lassie movies, when, as the saying goes, Lassie would jump up and spell "fire" in the mashed potatoes. It's a Disney special, all the way. Still and all, Secretariat was some great horse and that was some day at Woodbine way back when, meaning cold and dark, with rain that gusted to sleet. Yves Loiselle, the now-retired photo finish man at Greenwood and Woodbine, remembers he needed to light up the finish wire for a photo, something never before done on the turf course and possibly never done since, because turf races aren't run in the dark. Secretariat finished at Woodbine partly because owner Penny Chenery Tweedy, the Diane Lane of her day, was paying homage to Quebec-born trainer Lucien Laurin and jockey Ron Turcotte, a New Brunswick native. That and Woodbine also bumped the purse from $75,000 to $125,000. Still, Chenery Tweedy and Laurin walked the soaked turf course on race-day morning with nervous executives of what was then the Ontario Jockey Club before granting final approval to race him. After 1 5/8 miles, Secretariat romped by 6 ½ lengths over Big Spruce, having opened a 12-length advantage after putting away pace-setter Kennedy Road. The late race-caller Daryl Wells called out, "He's all yours!'' as Big Red thundered home and at least 100 people seemed to agree, charging across the dirt track to the outside fence of the inner grass course for a closer look. Scary stuff. "I remember a couple of things,'' said David Willmot, later Woodbine's CEO and now squire of Kinghaven Farms, which sends out Fifty Proof Saturday. "The first was (jockey Avelino) Gomez on Kennedy Road, trying to knock Secretariat down on the backstretch. That didn't work. "The other is that it was a very profitable day for Woodbine because of all the souvenir tickets that went home uncashed. That and the parking lots were so full people were parking in a soybean field to the west, in mud up to their axles. We were still clearing cars out of that field on the Wednesday.'' Those uncashed tickets? Many thousands of dollars. Someone called Woodbine the other day and said he had rediscovered a $100 win ticket on Secretariat and could he still cash it? The answer, 37 years later, is it's worth what you can get on eBay.
