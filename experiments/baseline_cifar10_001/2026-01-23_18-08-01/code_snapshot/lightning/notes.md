# Expeirment Notes (example)

## Experiemnt name:

Baseline training using a higher learning rate of 0.01

## Hypothesis:

The previous experiment seemed to converge too slowly. Trying a higher learning rate might improve convergence and accuracy

## Difference between this and previous experiment:

- Increased learning rate from 0.001 to 0.01
- Kept all other hyperparameters the same

## Results:

- Testing accuracy improved from 85% to 86%
- Validation loss decreased more rapidly than previous

## Conclusion:

The higher learning rate positively impacted the training speed and final accuracy. Further experiments could explore even higher

## Next steps:

- Test learning rates of 0.02 and 0.05
