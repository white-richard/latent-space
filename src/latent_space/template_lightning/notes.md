# Expeirment Notes

# --- Experiment Path ---

[Experiemnt path](./)

## Experiemnt summary

## Hypothesis:

The previous experiment seemed to converge too slowly. Trying a higher learning rate might improve convergence and accuracy

## Difference between this and previous experiment:

- Increased learning rate from 0.001 to 0.01
- Kept all other hyperparameters the same

## Results:

- Testing accuracy improved from 85% to 86%
- Validation loss decreased more rapidly than previous

## Conclusion:

The higher learning rate positively impacted the training speed and final accuracy. Further experiments could explore even higher

## Next steps:

- Test learning rates of 0.02 and 0.05

This is an example of how I document experiements. I prepend this for each experiment I run to notes.md in ./
I very much try to keep doing notes as minimal and quick as possible so I actually do them
But keeping notes is very important so that I can look back later and see what I have been doing
The experiements also saves copies of all of the code; this is useful with a file diff tool so I can see line by line what has changed over time
